{"problem": "If $60$ miles per hour is $88$ feet per second, how many feet per second is $66$ miles per hour? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "We have $60 \\text{ miles per hour} = 88 \\text{ feet per second}$. Multiplying both sides by $66/60$, we have $66 \\text{ miles per hour} = \\frac{66}{60} \\cdot 88 \\text{ feet per second} = \\boxed{96.8} \\text{ feet per second}$.", "wolframquery": "\n\nQuery: 66 miles per hour in feet per second", "wolframoutput": "(incompatible units)", "gptanswer": "\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{98.4}", "boxed": "boxed"}
