{"problem": "The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. What is the smallest of the even integers?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The first 8 odd positive integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, 15.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so their sum is $(1 + 15)/2 \\cdot 8 = 64$.\n\nLet the 5 consecutive even integers be $a$, $a + 2$, $a + 4$, $a + 6$, and $a + 8$.  Their sum is $5a + 20$.  But this is also $64 - 4 = 60$, so $5a + 20 = 60$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{8}$.", "wolframquery": "\n\nQuery: (5*x + 4)/2 = (1 + 8*y)/2, solve for x", "wolframoutput": "5 x + 4!=0 \u2227 hit = 0 \u2227 y = -1/8", "gptanswer": "\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{8}", "boxed": "boxed"}
