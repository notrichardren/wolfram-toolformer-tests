{"problem": "There is a number $C$. The number $C$ is a multiple of 7, but is NOT a multiple of 3. The number $C$ is greater than 20, but less than 30. What is this number $C$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "From the problem we can gather that $20<C<30$. Because $C$ is also a multiple of 7, that limits the possibilities for number $C$ down to 21 and 28. The last clue left states that number $C$ is also NOT a multiple of 3. Out of the two posibilities left, 21 is the only value that is also a multiple of 3, thus eliminating it from being number $C$. Thus, the number $C$ can only be $\\boxed{28}$.", "wolframquery": "\n\nQuery: 21 < C < 30, C mod 7 = 0, C mod 3 != 0", "wolframoutput": "{hit/21<\u00b0C (degree Celsius)<30, (\u00b0C (degree Celsius)) mod 7 = 0, (\u00b0C (degree Celsius)) mod 3!=0}", "gptanswer": "\n\n\\boxed{21}", "boxed": "boxed"}
