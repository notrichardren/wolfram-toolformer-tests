{"problem": "Find the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line $x+ y= 6$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The region bounded by these lines is a right-isosceles triangle with legs along the $x$ and $y$ axes.  The length of these legs are given by the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line which are both 6.  Thus the area of this region is $\\frac 12 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ square units.", "wolframquery": "\n\nQuery: area of region bounded by x-axis, y-axis, and x+y=6", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{9}$", "boxed": "boxed"}
