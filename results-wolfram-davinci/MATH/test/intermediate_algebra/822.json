{"problem": "What is the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is the magnitude of their difference. Therefore our distance is $|(5+6i)-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "wolframquery": "\n\nQuery: distance between (5+6i) and (-2+2i)", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{7\\sqrt{2}}", "boxed": "boxed"}
