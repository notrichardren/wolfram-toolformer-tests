{"problem": "What is the units digit of $19^{19}+99^{99}$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The units digit of a power of an integer is determined by the units digit of the integer; that is, the tens digit, hundreds digit, etc... of the integer have no effect on the units digit of the result. In this problem, the units digit of $19^{19}$ is the units digit of $9^{19}$. Note that $9^1=9$ ends in 9, $9^2=81$ ends in 1, $9^3=729$ ends in 9, and, in general, the units digit of odd powers of 9 is 9, whereas the units digit of even powers of 9 is 1. Since both exponents are odd, the sum of their units digits is $9+9=18$, the units digit of which is $\\boxed{8}.$", "wolframquery": "\n\nQuery: 19^19 + 99^99", "wolframoutput": "hit:369729637649726772657187905628805440595668764281741102430259972423552570455277523421410650010128232727940978889548326540119429996769494359451621570193644014418071060667659303363419435659472789623878", "gptanswer": "\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{7}", "boxed": "boxed"}
