{"problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and they are multiplied. What is the probability that the product is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ whose product is odd is $\\{1,3\\}$.  Since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\\{1,3\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\\dfrac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: probability of even product when two numbers are randomly selected from {1,2,3,4}", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "There are a total of $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. To have an even product, we must have at least one even number. There are three even numbers in the set, so there are $\\binom{3}{1}=3$ ways to choose one even number and one odd number. There are also $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ ways to choose two even numbers. Therefore, there are a total of $3+1=4$ ways to choose two numbers with an even product. Thus, the probability of choosing two numbers with an even product is $\\frac{4}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
