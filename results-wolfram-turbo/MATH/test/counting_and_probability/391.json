{"problem": "In the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10, what is the next number?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "The row that starts 1, 10 is the row $\\binom{10}{0}, \\binom{10}{1}, \\binom{10}{2},\\ldots$, so the next number is $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2\\cdot 1} = \\boxed{45}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: pascal triangle row 2 11", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The next number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10 is $\\boxed{45}$. \n\nTo find this, we can use the formula for the $k$th number in the $n$th row of Pascal's triangle: $\\binom{n}{k-1}$. \n\nThe row in question starts with 1 and then 10, so it is the 11th row of Pascal's triangle. The third number in this row (after 1 and 10) is the number in the 11th row, 2nd position, which is $\\binom{11}{1} = 11$. \n\nThe fourth number in the row is the number in the 11th row, 3rd position, which is $\\binom{11}{2} = 55$. \n\nTherefore, the next number in the row after 1, 10, 11, and 55 is $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{45}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
