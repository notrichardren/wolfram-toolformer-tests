Five of these pairs correspond to adjacent vertices, which when connected yield edges of the pentagon.  Connecting any one of the $10-5=\\boxed{5}$ remaining pairs of vertices yields a diagonal.", "wolframquery": "Query: number of unique diagonals in a 5-sided convex polygon", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The number of unique diagonals that can be drawn in a five-sided convex polygon is $\\boxed{5}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
