Since we can only move right or up, in order to get from $A$ to $B$, we must move right $5$ times and up $2$ times. The order in which we move right or up does not matter, so we can use combinations to count the number of ways to choose $5$ moves to be right and $2$ moves to be up. This is equivalent to choosing $2$ moves to be up out of a total of $7$ moves (since we must make a total of $7$ moves to get from $A$ to $B$). Therefore, the number of paths from $A$ to $B$ is $\\binom{7}{2} = \\boxed{21}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
