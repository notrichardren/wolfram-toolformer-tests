{"problem": "What is the positive difference between the greatest and least prime factors of 2000?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The prime factorization of 2000 is $2^4 \\times 5^3$ (build a factor tree if you need to see it). The greatest prime factor is 5 and the smallest prime factor is 2.  The difference is $5-2=\\boxed{3}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: abs(max(factor(2000, primes))-min(factor(2000, primes)))", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The prime factorization of 2000 is $2^4 \\cdot 5^3$. The greatest prime factor is 5 and the least prime factor is 2. Therefore, the positive difference between the greatest and least prime factors of 2000 is $5-2=\\boxed{3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
