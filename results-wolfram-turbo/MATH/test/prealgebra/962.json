{"problem": "A number is selected at random from 1 through 100, inclusive.  What is the probability that the number is a perfect square?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "There are 100 numbers possible between 1 and 100. There are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100: $1^2,2^2,\\ldots,10^2$.  So the probability that a randomly selected number is a perfect square is $\\dfrac{10}{100} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{10}}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: probability of selecting a perfect square from 1 to 100", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "There are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.
