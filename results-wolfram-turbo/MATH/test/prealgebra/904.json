{"problem": "What is the smallest 3-digit number of the form $aaa$ such that it is divisible by 9? (Here, $a$ represents a digit.)", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. If the number is of the above form, then the sum of its digits is $a+a+a=3a$. The smallest value of $a$ for which 9 divides $3a$ is $a=3$. Therefore, $\\boxed{333}$ is the smallest 3-digit number of the form $aaa$ which is divisible by 9.", "wolframquery": "Query: smallest 3-digit number of the form aaa divisible by 9", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. Since $aaa$ has three digits, the sum of its digits is $3a$. Therefore, $aaa$ is divisible by 9 if and only if $3a$ is divisible by 3. The smallest digit $a$ that satisfies this condition is $a=\\boxed{3}$. Thus, the smallest 3-digit number of the form $aaa$ that is divisible by 9 is 333.", "boxed": "boxed"}
