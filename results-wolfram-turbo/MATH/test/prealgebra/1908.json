{"problem": "How many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The factors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.  Of these, the $\\boxed{3}$ factors 10, 25 and 50 have two digits and are factors of 150 as well.", "wolframquery": "Query: factors of 100 and 150 with two digits", "wolframoutput": "{hit:2^2\u00d75^2, 300 digits}", "gptanswer": "The prime factorization of 100 is $2^2 \\cdot 5^2$ and the prime factorization of 150 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. The common factors are $2$ and $5^2$, so the positive two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 are the factors of $2 \\cdot 5^2 = 50$. The positive two-digit factors of 50 are 10, 25, and 50. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ positive two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150.", "boxed": "boxed"}
