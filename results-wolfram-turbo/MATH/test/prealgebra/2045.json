{"problem": "What is the mean of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The sum of the two fractions is $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{7}{8}=\\frac{11}{8}$.  So their mean is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{11}{8}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: (1/2 + 7/8)/2", "wolframoutput": "hit:11/16", "gptanswer": "$\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{7}{8}=\\frac{4}{8}+\\frac{7}{8}=\\frac{11}{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the mean of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
