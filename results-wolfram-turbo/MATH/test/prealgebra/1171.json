Express your answer as a common fraction.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "One interior angle of an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees while one interior angle of a square measures 90 degrees. The ratio is $60/90=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: ratio of interior angle of equilateral triangle to interior angle of square", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "An equilateral triangle has three equal interior angles, each measuring 60 degrees. A square has four equal interior angles, each measuring 90 degrees. Therefore, the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square is:\n\n$$\\frac{60^\\circ}{90^\\circ} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
