{"problem": "$97$ is the largest prime less than $100$. What is the largest prime factor of $97!$ (97 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "$\\boxed{97}$ is a prime factor, and everything else that is multiplied together to make $97!$ is less than it.", "wolframquery": "Query: largest prime factor of 97!", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "By Legendre's formula, the largest power of a prime $p$ that divides $n!$ is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$. Therefore, the largest prime factor of $97!$ is the largest prime $p$ such that $p$ divides $97!$. Since $97$ is the largest prime less than $100$, all primes less than $97$ divide $97!$. Therefore, we only need to check if $97$ divides $97!$. Indeed, $97$ divides $97!$, so the largest prime factor of $97!$ is $\\boxed{97}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
