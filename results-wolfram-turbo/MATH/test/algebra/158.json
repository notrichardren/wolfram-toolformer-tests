{"problem": "The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. What is the smallest of the even integers?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The first 8 odd positive integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, 15.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so their sum is $(1 + 15)/2 \\cdot 8 = 64$.\n\nLet the 5 consecutive even integers be $a$, $a + 2$, $a + 4$, $a + 6$, and $a + 8$.  Their sum is $5a + 20$.  But this is also $64 - 4 = 60$, so $5a + 20 = 60$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{8}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: sum of 5 consecutive even integers = sum of first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers - 4, find smallest even integer", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "Let's call the smallest even integer \"x\". Then the next four consecutive even integers would be x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8.\n\nThe sum of these five even integers would be:\n\nx + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20\n\nThe first eight consecutive odd counting numbers would be:\n\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\n\nTheir sum would be:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64\n\nSo we can set up the equation:\n\n5x + 20 = 64 - 4\n\nSimplifying:\n\n5x + 20 = 60\n\n5x = 40\n\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, the smallest even integer is $\\boxed{8}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
