{"problem": "Two consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.  What is the sum of the original  two numbers?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $x + 2$, where $x$ is even. We want to find $x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2$, and we are told that $(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60$. This last equation can be factored as a difference of squares: $(x + 2 + x)(x + 2 - x) = (2x + 2)(2) = 60$. It follows that $2x + 2 = 60/2 = \\boxed{30}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: sqrt(x^2) - sqrt((x+2)^2) = 60, solve for x and x+2, x>0, x is even", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "$\\boxed{14}$", "boxed": "boxed"}
