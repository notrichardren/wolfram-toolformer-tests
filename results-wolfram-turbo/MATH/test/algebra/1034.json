Since $A$ and $C$ are coprime, $C$ must be a factor of $2\\sqrt{3B}$. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, $3B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 3. Thus, $2\\sqrt{3B}$ must be a multiple of 3, which means $C$ must be a multiple of 3. Let $C=3D$ for some positive integer $D$. Then we have $\\frac{2A\\sqrt{3B}}{3D} = 9$, which simplifies to $\\frac{A\\sqrt{3B}}{D} = \\frac{27}{2}$. Since $A$ and $D$ are coprime, $D$ must be a factor of $\\sqrt{3B}$. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, $3B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 3. Thus, $D$ must be a multiple of 3, and we can let $D=3E$ for some positive integer $E$. Then we have $\\frac{A\\sqrt{3B}}{3E} = \\frac{27}{2}$, which simplifies to $A\\sqrt{3B} = \\frac{81}{2}E$. Since $A$ and $C$ are coprime, $A$ must be a factor of $\\frac{81}{2}$, which means $A$ must be 9 or 81. If $A=9$, then $\\sqrt{3B} = 18E$, which means $B$ is a perfect square, contradicting the problem statement. Thus, $A=81$, and we have $\\sqrt{3B} = \\frac{81}{2E}$. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, $3B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 3. Thus, $2E$ must be a multiple of 3, which means $E$ must be a multiple of 3. Let $E=3F$ for some positive integer $F$. Then we have $\\sqrt{3B} = \\frac{81}{2(3F)} = \\frac{27}{2F}$, which means $3B = \\frac{729}{4F^2}$. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, $729/4$ must be divisible by $B$, which means $B=4\\cdot3^4=324$. Finally, we have $A+B+C = 81+324+9\\cdot3\\boxed{=432}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
