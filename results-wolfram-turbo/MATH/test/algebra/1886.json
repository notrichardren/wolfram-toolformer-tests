{"problem": "At her track meet, Alice ran at a speed of $9\\ \\text{m/s}$ for $12$ seconds. How many meters did she run?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Letting $v$ denote speed, $x$ denote distance, and $t$ denote time, we have $v=\\frac{x}{t}$. In our problem, we're given that $v=9\\ \\text{m/s}$ and $t=12\\ \\text{s}$.
