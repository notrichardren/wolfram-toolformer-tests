{"problem": "What is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ in a coordinate system?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\boxed{10}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the origin, the point $(-8, 6)$, and the point $(-8, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse must be $\\boxed{10}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: distance between (0,0) and (-8,6)", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "We can use the distance formula to find the distance between the origin $(0,0)$ and the point $(-8,6)$:\n\n$$\\sqrt{(-8-0)^2 + (6-0)^2} = \\sqrt{64+36} = \\sqrt{100} = \\boxed{10}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
