{"problem": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days.", "wolframquery": "Query: 12 people * 10 days * daily share = supplies; (12+3) people * x days * daily share = supplies; solve for x.", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "$\\boxed{8}$ days. \n\nExplanation: Let $S$ be the total amount of supplies purchased. Then, we have $12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\text{daily share} = S$. When the group size increases to 15, the supplies still need to last for 10 days, so we have $15 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\text{daily share} = S$. Since the amount of supplies is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for the number of days, $d$: $$12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\text{daily share} = 15 \\cdot d \\cdot \\text{daily share} \\Rightarrow d = \\frac{12 \\cdot 10}{15} = 8.$$ Therefore, the supplies will last for $\\boxed{8}$ days.", "boxed": "boxed"}
