{"problem": "For how many values of $x$ is the expression $\\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}$  not defined?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The expression is not defined when the denominator is equal to zero. Thus, we need to find the number of values of $x$ such that $x^2-9=0$. Rearranging the equation and taking the square root of both sides, we have $x^2-9=0\\Rightarrow x^2=9 \\Rightarrow x=\\pm3$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ different values of $x$ that make the given expression undefined.", "wolframquery": "Query: (x-5)/(x^2-9) undefined values", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The expression $\\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}$ is undefined when the denominator $x^2-9$ is equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined. Thus, we need to solve the equation $x^2-9=0$. Factoring, we get $(x+3)(x-3)=0$, so the solutions are $x=-3$ and $x=3$. Therefore, the expression is undefined for $\\boxed{2}$ values of $x$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
