{"problem": "What is the sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The odd integers between 46 and 64 are 47, 49, $\\dots$, 63.  These integers form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $47 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 45$.\n\nIf $2n + 45 = 63$, then $n = 9$, so there are 9 such odd integers.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(47 + 63)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{495}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: sum of odd integers between 46 and 64", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The odd integers between 46 and 64 are 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, and 61.
