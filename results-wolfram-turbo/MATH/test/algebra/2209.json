{"problem": "For what value of the constant $a$ does the system of equations below have infinitely many solutions?  \\begin{align*} 2x + 5y &= -8,\\\\ 6x &= 16 + a - 15y \\end{align*}", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Putting the $x$ and $y$ terms of the second equation on the left gives $6x+15y = 16+a$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives $6x + 15y = -24$.  So, our system now is \\begin{align*} 6x+15y &= -24,\\\\ 6x + 15y&=16+a. \\end{align*}This system has infinitely many solutions only if the two right sides are the same, which would make the two equations the same.  So, we must have $-24 = 16+a$, so $a= \\boxed{-40}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: solve 2x + 5y = -8, 6x = 16 + a - 15y for a when there are infinitely many solutions", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "We can start by solving the first equation for $x$: $$2x + 5y = -8 \\implies x = -\\frac{5}{2}y - 4.$$ Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get $$6x = 16 + a - 15y \\implies 6\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}y - 4\\right) = 16 + a - 15y.$$ Simplifying this equation gives us $$-15y - 24 = \\frac{a}{3}.$$ Solving for $a$ in terms of $y$, we get $$a = -45y - 72.$$ Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions if and only if $a$ can be expressed in the form $-45y - 72$ for some value of $y$. Since $y$ can take on any value, $a$ can take on any value as well. \n\n$$\\boxed{a \\text{ can be any real number.}}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
