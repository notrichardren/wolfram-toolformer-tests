{"problem": "The sum of the first $N$ positive odd numbers is 121. What is the value of $N$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The first $N$ positive odd integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, $2N - 1$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the first $N$ positive odd integers is \\[\\frac{1 + (2N - 1)}{2} \\cdot N = N^2.\\]If $N^2 = 121$, then $N = \\boxed{11}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: sum of first N odd numbers = 121", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The sum of the first $N$ odd numbers is given by $N^2$. Therefore, we have $N^2=121$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $N= \\boxed{11}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
