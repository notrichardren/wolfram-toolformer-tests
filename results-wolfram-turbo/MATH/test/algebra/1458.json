We can start by looking for two numbers that multiply to $6\\cdot(-51)=-306$ and add to $-1$. After some trial and error, we find that $-18$ and $17$ work. So we can write:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6y^2-y-51 &= 6y^2-18y+17y-51 \\\\\n&= 6y(y-3)+17(y-3) \\\\\n&= (6y+17)(y-3)\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, $A=2$, $B=17$, and $C=3$, so $(AC)^2-B=(2\\cdot 3)^2-17=\\boxed{23}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
