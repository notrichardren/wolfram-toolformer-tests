{"problem": "Alice, Bailey, Cindy, and Daniel walked around their neighborhoods selling pens. Alice earned $\\$25.67$, Bailey earned $\\$17.21$, Cindy earned $\\$39.17$, and Daniel earned $\\$26.32$. After the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars.

We convert the amount they earned to cents and find the modulo $100$ for each.  \\begin{align*}\n2567 &\\equiv 67 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n1721 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n3917 &\\equiv 17 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n2632 &\\equiv 32 \\pmod{100}\n\\end{align*}We want to find the modulo $100$ of the total number of cents.

This gives us $$108,$$ so they had $$10800$$ cents in total. Subtracting the amount they earned, we get $$10800 - (2567+1721+3917+2632) = \\boxed{963}.$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
