{"problem": "What is the units digit of $19^{19}+99^{99}$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The units digit of a power of an integer is determined by the units digit of the integer; that is, the tens digit, hundreds digit, etc... of the integer have no effect on the units digit of the result. In this problem, the units digit of $19^{19}$ is the units digit of $9^{19}$. Note that $9^1=9$ ends in 9, $9^2=81$ ends in 1, $9^3=729$ ends in 9, and, in general, the units digit of odd powers of 9 is 9, whereas the units digit of even powers of 9 is 1. Since both exponents are odd, the sum of their units digits is $9+9=18$, the units digit of which is $\\boxed{8}.$", "wolframquery": "Query: units digit of 19^19+99^99", "wolframoutput": "hit:1978419655660313589123979 digit + 369729637649726772657187905628805440595668764281741102430259972423552570455277523421410650010128232727940978889548326540119429996769494359451621570193644014418071060667659301384999779999159200499899", "gptanswer": "We only need to consider the units digit of $19^{19}$ and $99^{99}$ since the other digits do not affect the units digit of their sum. \n\nThe units digit of $19^{19}$ follows a pattern: $9,1,9,1,\\ldots$. Since $19$ is odd, the units digit of $19^{19}$ is $9$.\n\nThe units digit of $99^{99}$ also follows a pattern: $9,1,9,1,\\ldots$.
