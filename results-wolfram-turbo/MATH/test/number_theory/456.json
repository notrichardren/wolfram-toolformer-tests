{"problem": "The word MATH is repeatedly written producing the pattern MATHMATHMATH... If the pattern is continued, what letter will occur in the 2009th position?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "If $n$ is a multiple of 4, the the $n$th letter written is H.  Therefore, the 2008th letter written is H and the 2009th letter is $\\boxed{\\text{M}}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: character at position 2009 in MATH repeated infinitely", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The pattern MATH repeats every 4 letters, so we can find the remainder when 2009 is divided by 4. \n\n$2009 \\div 4 = 502$ with a remainder of 1. \n\nTherefore, the 2009th letter in the pattern is the same as the 1st letter, which is $\\boxed{M}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
