{"problem": "What is the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits such that the digits add up to 20?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "For the number to be as small as possible, the leftmost digit should be as small as possible. Therefore, the ten thousandth digit should be $1$. The other four digits would have to add up to $20-1=19$. The leftmost digit is now the thousandth digit, which should be the smallest number possible, $1$. We can also put a $1$ in the hundredths place.  The last two digits then have to add up to $20-1-1-1=17$.  The only single-digit numbers that add to $17$ are $8$ and $9$.  Since $8$ is smaller, that goes in the tens place, and the $9$ goes in the ones place.  Therefore, the smallest five-digit number possible is $\\boxed{11189}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: smallest 5-digit number with non-zero digits and digits add up to 20", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits is 10,000. To make the digits add up to 20, we need to distribute the remaining 20 - 1 = 19 among the four digits. We can do this by using the \"stars and bars\" method, where we place 3 bars among 19 stars to divide them into 4 groups. There are a total of (19 + 3) choose 3 = 22,176 ways to do this. However, we cannot have any group with more than 9 stars, since that would make the digit greater than 9. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of ways where at least one group has 10 or more stars.\n\nIf one group has 10 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 9 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (9 + 3) choose 3 = 2,376 ways.\n\nIf one group has 11 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 8 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (8 + 3) choose 3 = 1,848 ways.\n\nIf one group has 12 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 7 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (7 + 3) choose 3 = 1,296 ways.\n\nIf one group has 13 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 6 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (6 + 3) choose 3 = 792 ways.\n\nIf one group has 14 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 5 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (5 + 3) choose 3 = 384 ways.\n\nIf one group has 15 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 4 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (4 + 3) choose 3 = 168 ways.\n\nIf one group has 16 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 3 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (3 + 3) choose 3 = 48 ways.\n\nIf one group has 17 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 2 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (2 + 3) choose 3 = 20 ways.\n\nIf one group has 18 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 1 star among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (1 + 3) choose 3 = 4 ways.\n\nIf one group has 19 stars, we can choose which group that is in 4 ways, and then distribute the remaining 0 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of 4 * (0 + 3) choose 3 = 4 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to distribute the stars and bars without any group having more than 9 stars is 22,176 - 2,376 - 1,848 - 1,296 - 792 - 384 - 168 - 48 - 20 - 4 - 4 = 16,116.\n\nEach of these distributions corresponds to a unique five-digit number with non-zero digits whose digits add up to 20. To find the smallest such number, we want to minimize the leftmost digit. Since we cannot have a leading zero, the leftmost digit must be at least 1. We can achieve this by putting one star in the leftmost group and distributing the remaining 18 stars among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This gives us a total of (18 + 3) choose 3 = 1,140 ways to distribute the stars and bars in this way.\n\nTherefore, the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits whose digits add up to 20 is the one corresponding to the distribution where the leftmost group has one star and the remaining 18 stars are distributed among the other 3 groups using stars and bars. This corresponds to the number:\n\n$$\\boxed{10,002}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
