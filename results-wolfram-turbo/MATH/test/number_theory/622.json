{"problem": "What value of $k$ makes the positive five-digit integer $k3,\\!57k$ divisible by 18?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Since $18=2\\cdot 3^2$, an integer is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  For $k3,\\!57k$ to be divisible by 2, $k$ must be even.  To determine whether $k3,\\!57k$ is divisible by 9, we find the sum of its digits, which is $2k+15$.  Substituting $k=0,2,4,\\ldots$, we find that none of the numbers 15, 19, or 23 are divisible by 9, but $15+2(6)=27$ is divisible by 9.  Therefore, $k=\\boxed{6}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: divisible 357k by 18", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "For a number to be divisible by 18, it must be divisible by both 9 and 2. To check if a number is divisible by 9, we can check if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nAdding the digits of $k3,\\!57k$, we get $k+3+5+7+k=2k+15$. For this to be divisible by 9, $2k+15$ must be a multiple of 9. This means $2k$ must be 3 less than a multiple of 9. The only single-digit value of $k$ that satisfies this is $k=6$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ that makes $k3,\\!57k$ divisible by 18 is $\\boxed{6}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
