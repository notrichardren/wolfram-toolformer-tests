{"problem": "The two-digit number $``B6,''$ where $B$ is the tens digit, is the square of a positive integer. How many distinct possible values are there for $B$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Of the two-digit perfect squares, only $4^2=16$ and $6^2=36$ end in $6$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct possible values for $B$.", "wolframquery": "Query: sqrt(100B+36)=n, solve for B, where n is an integer and 1<=n<=9.", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "We can write the given number as $10B+6$. We want this to be a perfect square, so let's write it as $(\\sqrt{k})^2$ for some positive integer $k$. Then we have $10B+6=k$. Rearranging, we get $B=\\frac{k-6}{10}$. Since $B$ must be a digit, $k-6$ must be a multiple of $10$. The possible values of $k$ are $16,26,36,46,56,66,76,86,96$. For each of these values, we can compute the corresponding value of $B$ using $B=\\frac{k-6}{10}$. We get $B=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$, respectively. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{9}$ distinct possible values for $B$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
