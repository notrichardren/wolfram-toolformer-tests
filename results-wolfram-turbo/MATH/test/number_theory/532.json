Since we cannot subtract $4$ from $2$ in base $7,$ we need to borrow $1$ from the $6$ in the $49$s place, giving us $12_7.$ Now we can subtract $4$ from $12_7$ to get $8_7.$ Finally, we subtract the $5$ in the $343$s place from the $1$ in the $343$s place, but we need to borrow $1$ from the $7$ in the $2401$s place, giving us $6.$ Therefore, our final answer is $\\boxed{68_7}.$", "boxed": "boxed"}
