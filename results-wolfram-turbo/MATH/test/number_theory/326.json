{"problem": "The product of three consecutive integers is 720. What is the largest of these integers?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Let the integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.  Their product is $n^3-n$.  Thus $n^3=720+n$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than $720$ is $729=9^3$, and indeed $729=720+9$.  So $n=9$ and the largest of the integers is $n+1=\\boxed{10}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: largest integer from product of three consecutive integers = 720", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "Let the smallest of the three consecutive integers be $n$. Then the next two integers are $n+1$ and $n+2$. We know that their product is 720, so we can set up the equation: $$n(n+1)(n+2)=720$$ Expanding the left side, we get: $$n^3+3n^2+2n=720$$ Rearranging and factoring, we get: $$n^3+3n^2+2n-720=0$$ $$(n-8)(n^2+11n+90)=0$$ The solutions to this equation are $n=8$, $n=-10$, and $n=-1$. Since we are looking for the largest of the three consecutive integers, our answer is $\\boxed{10}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
