{"problem": "Let $M$ and $N$ denote the greatest and least positive two-digit multiples of 13. What is the value of $M + N$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The least positive two-digit multiple of 13 is 13, so $N=13$. The greatest positive two-digit multiple of 13 is $7\\cdot13=91$, so $M=91$. The sum is $M+N=91+13=\\boxed{104}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: greatest multiple of 13 less than 100 + least multiple of 13 greater than 9", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The greatest multiple of 13 less than 100 is 91, and the least multiple of 13 greater than 9 is 13.
