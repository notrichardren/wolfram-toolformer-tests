{"problem": "The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. What is the greater of the two integers?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "First we find the prime factorization of 288 to be $2^5\\cdot 3^2$, and we have to split these factors among two consecutive even integers. The 3 must be with at least one 2 for the integer to be even, meaning one of the factors must be a multiple of $6.$ After some playing around, we find that when one factor is 18, that leaves us with $2^4=16$. So, our two integers are 16 and 18, with the greater integer being $\\boxed{18}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: (x*(x+2)=288) and x is even and x>0, x+2>0, solve for x+2", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The two consecutive even integers can be represented as $x$ and $x+2$, where $x$ is even and positive. We are given that their product is 288, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$$x(x+2)=288$$\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n$$x^2+2x=288$$\n\nMoving all the terms to one side, we have:\n\n$$x^2+2x-288=0$$\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation as:\n\n$$(x+18)(x-16)=0$$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $x$ are $-18$ and $16$. However, $x$ must be even and positive, so the only valid solution is $x=16$. \n\nTherefore, the greater of the two consecutive even integers is $x+2=16+2=\\boxed{18}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
