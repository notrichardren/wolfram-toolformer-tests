{"problem": "What is the only integer value of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is a positive prime number?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is negative if $n$ is less than $-1$ or greater than $13$, so $n$ must be between 0 and $12$ inclusive.  Also, since $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is prime, it must be greater than or equal to 2.  Solving \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{n+1}{13-n} &\\geq 2 \\\\\nn+1 &\\geq 26-2n \\\\\n3n &\\geq 25 \\\\\nn &\\geq 8\\frac{1}{3},\n\\end{align*} we only have to check 9, 10, 11, and 12.  (The multiplication by $13-n$ is justified since we have already know that $n$ is less than 13).  We find that when $n=\\boxed{12},$ the expression equals 13.", "wolframquery": "Query: solve (n+1)/(13-n) is prime and positive, n is integer", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "Since $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is a positive prime number, we know that $n+1$ and $13-n$ must have the same sign. If $n+1$ and $13-n$ are both positive, then $n<13-n$, which implies $n<6.5$, so $n\\leq 6$. Checking each of these values, we see that $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is not a prime number for $n=1,2,3,4,5,6$.\n\nIf $n+1$ and $13-n$ are both negative, then $n>-1$ and $n>13$, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, $n+1$ and $13-n$ must both be negative. This implies $n>13$ and $n+1<0$, so $n\\leq -2$. Checking each of these values, we see that $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is not a prime number for $n=-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13$.\n\nThus, the only integer value of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is a positive prime number is $\\boxed{n=-14}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
