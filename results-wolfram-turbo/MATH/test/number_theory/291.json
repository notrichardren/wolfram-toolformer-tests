{"problem": "Let $N$ be the product of all integers from 1 through 10 that are not divisible by 5. What is the units digit of $N$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "$N=1\\times2\\times3\\times4\\times6\\times7\\times8\\times9$. We find the units digit of $N$ by disregarding the other digits as we progressively multiply: the units digit of $1\\times2$ is 2; the units digit of $2\\times3$ is 6; the units digit of $6\\times4$ is 4; the units digit of $4\\times6$ is 4; the units digit of $4\\times7$ is 8; the units digit of $8\\times8$ is 4; finally, the units digit of $4\\times9$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{6}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: product of (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9) mod 10", "wolframoutput": "hit:\u03a0{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}", "gptanswer": "The units digit of the product of (1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9) is the same as the units digit of the product of (2,4,6,8) since the other digits do not affect the units digit. The product of (2,4,6,8) is 2*4*6*8 = 384, which has a units digit of $\\boxed{4}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
