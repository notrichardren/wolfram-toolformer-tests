The units digit of $7^1$ is 7, the units digit of $7^2$ is 9, the units digit of $7^3$ is 3, and the units digit of $7^4$ is 1. From here, the pattern repeats every 4 powers. Therefore, the units digit of $7^7$ is the same as the units digit of $7^{7 \\bmod 4} = 7^3 = \\boxed{3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
