{"problem": "Express as a common fraction: $\\frac{. \\overline{7} }{. \\overline{8} }$", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "If we remember that $.\\overline{1}=\\frac{1}{9}$, then we know $.\\overline{7}=\\frac{7}{9}$ and $.\\overline{8}=\\frac{8}{9}$. We can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{\\frac79}{\\frac89}=\\boxed{\\frac78}$.\n\nIf we didn't know that $.\\overline{1}=\\frac{1}{9}$, we could let $x=.\\overline{7}$. Then $10x=7.\\overline{7}$ and $10x-x=9x=7$. So $x=\\frac79=.\\overline{7}$. Similarly, we could find that $.\\overline{8}=\\frac{8}{9}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: (0.7 recurring)/(0.8 recurring) as a fraction", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "We can start by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 10 to get rid of the decimals: \n\n$$\\frac{. \\overline{7} }{. \\overline{8} } = \\frac{7.\\overline{7}}{8.\\overline{8}}$$\n\nNext, we can subtract the original fraction from 1 to get:\n\n$$1 - \\frac{7.\\overline{7}}{8.\\overline{8}} = \\frac{1}{8.\\overline{8}}$$\n\nFinally, we can simplify this fraction by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 11:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{8.\\overline{8}} = \\frac{11}{99}$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{99}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
