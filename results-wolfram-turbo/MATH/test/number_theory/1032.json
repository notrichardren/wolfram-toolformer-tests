{"problem": "What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Let $M$ be the least positive multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. First, $M$ is a multiple of 10, so its units digit must be 0. $M$ is also a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, we must take at least  three 2's. Since $M$ is minimal, we take exactly three 2's and do not have any additional 0's: $M=\\boxed{2220}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: smallest multiple of 30 with digits 0 and 2", "wolframoutput": "hit:0", "gptanswer": "We need to find the smallest multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. Since 30 is divisible by both 2 and 3, any multiple of 30 must also be divisible by both 2 and 3. \n\nTo be divisible by 2, the last digit of the multiple must be even, which means it must be 0 or 2. To be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits of the multiple must be divisible by 3. \n\nThe smallest multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is obtained by starting with the smallest even digit (0) and adding digits until the sum is divisible by 3. We can see that the sum of the digits of 20 is 2, the sum of the digits of 220 is 4, and the sum of the digits of 2220 is 6, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is $\\boxed{2220}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
