{"problem": "What is the greatest three-digit integer in which the product of the digits is 6?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "$6=1\\cdot1\\cdot6=1\\cdot2\\cdot3$. To find the greatest three-digit integer the product of whose digits is 6, maximize first the hundreds digit, then the tens digit, and finally the units digit. Of the nine such integers, $\\boxed{611}$ is the greatest.", "wolframquery": "Query: max integer xyz such that x*y*z=6 and x,y,z are digits", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$. Since we want the greatest three-digit integer, we want the hundreds digit to be as large as possible. Therefore, we start with 9 as the hundreds digit. Then, we need to find two digits whose product is 6. The only possibilities are 2 and 3. We want the tens digit to be as large as possible, so we choose 3 as the tens digit. Therefore, the greatest three-digit integer in which the product of the digits is 6 is $\\boxed{932}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
