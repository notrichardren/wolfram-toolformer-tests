This tells us that  \\[2n=n+n\\equiv 3+3\\equiv1\\pmod5.\\] The remainder is $\\boxed{1}$ when the number is divided by 5.", "wolframquery": "Query: mod(x,5)=3, mod(2x,5)", "wolframoutput": "{hit/(x mod 5) = 3, (2 x) mod 5}", "gptanswer": "The remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is $\\boxed{1}$. \n\nWe can use the fact that when the number is divided by 5, the remainder is 3 to write the number in the form $5k+3$ for some integer $k$. \n\nThen, twice the number is $2(5k+3) = 10k+6$. \n\nWhen we divide this by 5, we get a remainder of 1: \n\n$10k+6 = 5(2k+1) + 1$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is $\\boxed{1}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
