{"problem": "What is the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles of a triangle if two of the interior angles have measures of 63 and 78 degrees?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The exterior angles of a triangle sum to $360^\\circ$, so the average of their measures is $360^\\circ/3 = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: mean of exterior angles of triangle with interior angles 63 and 78 degrees", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, the third interior angle of the triangle can be found by subtracting the sum of the given interior angles from 180 degrees: \n\n180 - 63 - 78 = 39 \n\nNow, we know that the sum of an exterior angle and its corresponding interior angle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, the measure of each exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. \n\nThe three non-adjacent interior angles of the triangle are 63, 78, and 39 degrees. Therefore, the measures of the corresponding exterior angles are: \n\n78 + 39 = 117 \n63 + 39 = 102 \n63 + 78 = 141 \n\nThe mean of these three exterior angles can be found by adding them up and dividing by 3: \n\n(117 + 102 + 141) / 3 = 120 \n\nTherefore, the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles of the triangle is $\\boxed{120}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
