{"problem": "How many square units are in the area of the largest square that can be inscribed in a circle with radius 1 unit?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The diagonal of a square inscribed in a circle is a diameter of the circle, so the length of the diagonal of the square is 2 units.  Recall that the area of a square with diagonal $d$ is $d^2/2$.  The area of a square whose diagonal measures 2 units is $2^2/2=\\boxed{2}$ square units.\n\nNote: To derive the area formula $d^2/2$, divide the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.  The side length of the square is $d/\\sqrt{2}$ and its area $(d/\\sqrt{2})^2=d^2/2$.", "wolframquery": "Query: area of largest square inscribed in circle with radius 1", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The largest square that can be inscribed in a circle will have its diagonal equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the diagonal of the square will be 2 units (twice the radius of the circle). Let the side length of the square be x. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$x^2 + x^2 = 2^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$2x^2 = 4$\n\n$x^2 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the area of the largest square that can be inscribed in a circle with radius 1 unit is:\n\n$\\boxed{2}$ square units.", "boxed": "boxed"}
