{"problem": "Two sides of a triangle have lengths of 18 and 29 units. If the third side has an integer length, what is the positive difference between the maximum and minimum length of the third side?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "Let the third side have a length of $x$ units.  By the triangle inequality, $29<x+18$ and $x<18+29$.  Solving these two inequalities, we find $11<x<47$.  Therefore, the maximum and minimum integral values of $x$ are $46$ and $12$, respectively.  The difference between these two values is $46-12=\\boxed{34}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: abs(maximum value of x where x is an integer and 11<x<47 and x+18>29 and 29+x>18) - minimum value of x where x is an integer and 11<x<47 and x+18>29 and 29+x>18", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The third side must satisfy the triangle inequality, which states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. Therefore, we have the inequalities:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n18 + 29 &> \\text{third side} \\\\\n29 + \\text{third side} &> 18 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying the first inequality gives $\\text{third side} < 47$, and simplifying the second inequality gives $\\text{third side} > 11$. Since the third side must be an integer, the possible values for the third side are $12, 13, \\ldots, 46$. We can eliminate some of these values by noting that the difference between the lengths of the two given sides is $29 - 18 = 11$, so the third side cannot be equal to $11$ or $12$. Similarly, the third side cannot be equal to $46$ or $47$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for the third side are $13, 14, \\ldots, 45$. The maximum value occurs when the third side is as large as possible, which is $45$. The minimum value occurs when the third side is as small as possible, which is $29 - 18 + 1 = 12$. Thus, the positive difference between the maximum and minimum length of the third side is:\n\n$$\\boxed{33}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
