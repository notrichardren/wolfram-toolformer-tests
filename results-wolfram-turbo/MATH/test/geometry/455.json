{"problem": "For a particular circle, a central angle of $75^{\\circ}$ will intercept an arc of length $10\\pi$ feet. What is the radius of this circle?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "A central angle of $75^\\circ$ cuts off an arc that is $\\frac{75}{360} = \\frac{5}{24}$ of the circumference of the circle.  Since $\\frac{5}{24}$ of the circle's circumference is $10\\pi$, the entire circumference of the circle is  $10\\pi \\cdot \\frac{24}{5} = 48\\pi$.  Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 48, and the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{24}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: radius of circle with central angle 75 degrees and arc length 10pi", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "Let $r$ be the radius of the circle. We know that the length of the arc is $10\\pi$ feet and the central angle is $75^{\\circ}$. \n\nThe circumference of the circle is $2\\pi r$, so the fraction of the circumference that the arc represents is $\\frac{10\\pi}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{5}{r}$. \n\nSince the central angle is $75^{\\circ}$, it represents $\\frac{75}{360} = \\frac{5}{24}$ of the total angle around the circle. Therefore, the fraction of the circumference that the arc represents is also $\\frac{5}{24}$. \n\nSetting the two expressions for the fraction of the circumference equal to each other, we have $\\frac{5}{r} = \\frac{5}{24}$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\boxed{24}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
