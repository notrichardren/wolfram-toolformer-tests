Since $\\triangle CFB$ is a $3-4-5$ right triangle, we have $CB = 10$ and $CF = 8$. Therefore, $FB = 6$ implies $BC = 8$, and $CE = CG = \\frac{BC}{2} = 4$. \n\nNext, we find the area of $\\triangle CEF$.

Since $DE = GF$, we have $\\triangle DEF \\cong \\triangle GEF$ by SAS congruence. Therefore, $EF = DG = 2$, and the height of the trapezoid is $HF = 12$. The bases of the trapezoid are $DE = GF = 2$ and $CG + CE = 8$. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot HF \\cdot (DE + GF) + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot HF \\cdot (CG + CE) = 72$. \n\nFinally, the area of pentagon $CDEFG$ is the sum of the areas of $\\triangle CEF$ and trapezoid $DEFG$, which is $8 + 72 = \\boxed{80}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
