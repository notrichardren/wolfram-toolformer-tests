{"problem": "Consider the graph of $$\\frac{x^3-x^2+x}{6x^2-9x}.$$Let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "We can factor the numerator and denominator to get $\\frac{x^3-x^2+x}{6x^2-9x} =\\frac{x(x^2-x+1)}{3x(2x-3)}.$\nIn this representation we can immediately see that there is a hole at $x=0$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=\\frac{3}{2}$. There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes so $a=1$ and $b=1$. If we cancel out the common factors, our rational function simplifies to\n$$\\frac{x^2-x+1}{3(2x-3)}.$$We see that as $x$ becomes very large, the $x^2$ term in the numerator will dominate. To be more precise, we can use polynomial division to write $\\frac{x^2-x+1}{3(2x-3)}$ as $$\\frac{2x+1}{12}+\\frac{7}{12(2x-3)},$$from which we can see that for large $x,$ the graph tends towards $\\frac{2x+1}{12},$ giving us an oblique asymptote.\n\nSince the graph cannot have more than one oblique asymptote, or an oblique asymptote and a horizontal asymptote, we have that $c=0$ and $d=1$. Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2+0+4 = \\boxed{7}.$", "wolframquery": "Query: plot (x^3-x^2+x)/(6x^2-9x) and find holes, vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and oblique asymptotes", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "Factoring the numerator and denominator, we have $$\\frac{x(x-1)}{3x(2x-3)}.$$We see that $x=0$ and $x=\\frac{3}{2}$ are vertical asymptotes, and there is no horizontal asymptote since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. To find oblique asymptotes, we divide the numerator by the denominator using long division or synthetic division: $$\\begin{array}{c|ccccc} & & x & -\\frac{1}{2} & +\\frac{1}{4} & -\\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} 3x(2x-3) & x^3 & -x^2 & +x & & \\\\ - & 3x^2 & -\\frac{9}{2}x & & & \\\\ \\cline{2-4} & x^3 & -\\frac{7}{2}x^2 & +\\frac{5}{2}x & & \\\\ - & x^3 & -\\frac{3}{2}x^2 & & & \\\\ \\cline{2-3} & & -2x^2 & +\\frac{5}{2}x & & \\\\ - & & -2x^2 & +3x & & \\\\ \\cline{3-4} & & & -\\frac{1}{2}x & & \\\\ \\end{array}$$Thus, the oblique asymptote is $y=x-\\frac{1}{2}$. To find holes, we factor the numerator and denominator again: $$\\frac{x(x-1)}{3x(2x-3)}=\\frac{(x-1)}{6(2x-3)}.$$We see that $x=\\frac{3}{2}$ is a hole since it makes the denominator zero, but not the numerator. Therefore, $a=1$, $b=2$, $c=0$, and $d=1$, so $a+2b+3c+4d=\\boxed{9}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
