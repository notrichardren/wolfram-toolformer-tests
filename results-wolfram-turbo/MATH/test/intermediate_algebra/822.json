{"problem": "What is the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is the magnitude of their difference. Therefore our distance is $|(5+6i)-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: abs((5+6i)-(-2+2i))", "wolframoutput": "hit:sqrt(65)", "gptanswer": "The distance between two complex numbers $a+bi$ and $c+di$ is given by $|a+bi-c-di|$. Applying this formula to $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$, we get $|5+6i-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|$. Using the Wolfram Query response, we have $|7+4i|=\\sqrt{65}$. Therefore, the distance between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
