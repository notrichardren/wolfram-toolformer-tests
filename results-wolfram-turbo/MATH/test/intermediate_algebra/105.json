The theorem states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients has a rational root $\\frac{p}{q}$ (where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors), then $p$ must divide the constant term and $q$ must divide the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is 4, which has factors of $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 4$. The leading coefficient is 1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 4$.\n\nWe can test each of these values using synthetic division or long division to see if they are roots of the polynomial. However, we find that none of these values are roots of the polynomial. Therefore, there are no possible integer roots of the polynomial.\n\n$$\\boxed{\\text{No integer roots}}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
