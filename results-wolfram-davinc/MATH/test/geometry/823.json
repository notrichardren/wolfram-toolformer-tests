{"problem": "The measures of the sides of a triangle are 7, 24 and 25. What is the area of the triangle?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "We notice that $7^2+24^2=49+576=625$. Since $7^2+24^2=25^2$, the side lengths 7, 24, and 25 are the side lengths of a right triangle with legs 7 and 24 units, and hypotenuse 25 units. Thus, we can find the area of the triangle by multiplying $1/2$ by the product of lengths of the bases to get $(1/2)(7)(24)=7\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{84}$ square units.", "wolframquery": "\n\nQuery: area of triangle with sides 7, 24, 25", "wolframoutput": "{hit:59.104 mi^2 (square miles), 24, 25}", "gptanswer": "\n\n\\boxed{59.104 \\text{ mi}^2}", "boxed": "boxed"}
