{"problem": "The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$  Let $h(x) = 2f(x) - 7.$  Find the range of the function $h(x).$", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Let $y = f(x),$ so $y$ can take on any value from $-3$ to 5, inclusive.  Then $2y - 7$ can take on any value from $2(-3) - 7 = -13$ to $2(5) - 7 = 3,$ inclusive.  Therefore, the range of $h(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-13,3]}.$", "gptanswer": " Since $f(-3) = -3$ and $f(5) = 5,$ the range of $f$ is $\\boxed{(-3,5)}.$\n\nSince $h(x) = 2f(x) - 7,$ $h(-3) = (-3) \\cdot (-3) - 7 = -21 - 7 = \\boxed{-14},$ and $h(5) = 5 \\cdot 5 - 7 = 25 - 7 = \\boxed{18}.$\n\nThus, the range of $h$ is $\\boxed{(-14,18)}.$", "boxed": "boxed"}
