Your final answer should be boxed in LaTeX. Please only put a mathematical expression or number in the boxed answer; leave out text of any form like names or natural language.\n\nThe answer in the box should not have any text unless it is a multiple choice question. For example, boxing \"the answer is 2\" is not acceptable; boxing \"2\" is. Boxing \"A\" for a multiple choice output is also acceptable. It should also not contain the name of the variable. For instance, \"x=2\" is not acceptable; boxing \"2\" is. It should should only contain the very", "boxed": "bracketerror"}
