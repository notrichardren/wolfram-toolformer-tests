{"problem": "Determine if the graph of the equation below is a parabola, circle, ellipse, hyperbola, point, line, two lines, or empty.\n\n$(x-3)^2 + y^2 = 10$", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "This is the equation of a $\\boxed{\\text{circle}}$ with center $(3,0)$ and radius $\\sqrt{10}$.", "gptanswer": " Since $x-3>0$ and $y^2>0$, the graph is not empty. Since $x-3>0$ and $y^2=10$, the graph is not a line. Since $x-3^2>0$ and $y^2=10$, the graph is not a point. Since $x-3^2>0$ and $y^2>0$, the graph is not an ellipse. Since $x-3^2>0$ and $y^2<10$, the graph is not a hyperbola. Since $x-3^2>0$ and $y^2=10$, the graph is not a circle. Since $x-3^2>0$ and $y^2<10$, the graph is not a parabola. The graph is either a point or an ellipse. Since $x-3^2>0$ and $y^2<10$, the graph is not a point. Therefore, the graph is an ellipse.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\ndraw((-4.5,0)--(4.5,0));\ndraw((-4.5,-0.5)--(4.5,-0.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-1)--(4.5,-1));\ndraw((-4.5,-1.5)--(4.5,-1.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-2)--(4.5,-2));\ndraw((-4.5,-2.5)--(4.5,-2.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-3)--(4.5,-3));\ndraw((-4.5,-3.5)--(4.5,-3.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-4)--(4.5,-4));\ndraw((-4.5,-4.5)--(4.5,-4.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-5)--(4.5,-5));\ndraw((-4.5,-5.5)--(4.5,-5.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-6)--(4.5,-6));\ndraw((-4.5,-6.5)--(4.5,-6.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-7)--(4.5,-7));\ndraw((-4.5,-7.5)--(4.5,-7.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-8)--(4.5,-8));\ndraw((-4.5,-8.5)--(4.5,-8.5));\ndraw((-4.5,-9)--(4.5,-9));\ndraw((-4", "boxed": "nobox"}
