These 6 steps can be made in any order, so the answer is $\\binom{6}{4} = \\boxed{15}$.", "gptanswer": " There are $w$ steps from $C$ to $B$. Every step must be up or to the right, so there are $w$ choices for the first step, $w-1$ choices for the second step, $w-2$ choices for the third step, and so on until we reach $0$ choices for the $w$th step.
