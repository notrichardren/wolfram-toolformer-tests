{"problem": "What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Let $M$ be the least positive multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. First, $M$ is a multiple of 10, so its units digit must be 0. $M$ is also a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, we must take at least  three 2's. Since $M$ is minimal, we take exactly three 2's and do not have any additional 0's: $M=\\boxed{2220}$.", "gptanswer": " Since $30=3\\cdot10$, we can try to find a multiple of $30$ in the form $3k+1$. We can see that $3\\cdot0+1=0$, $3\\cdot1+1=4$, $3\\cdot2+1=7$, and $3\\cdot3+1=10$. We can see that the only possible answer is $7$, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
