{"problem": "What is the only integer value of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is a positive prime number?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is negative if $n$ is less than $-1$ or greater than $13$, so $n$ must be between 0 and $12$ inclusive.  Also, since $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is prime, it must be greater than or equal to 2.  Solving \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{n+1}{13-n} &\\geq 2 \\\\\nn+1 &\\geq 26-2n \\\\\n3n &\\geq 25 \\\\\nn &\\geq 8\\frac{1}{3},\n\\end{align*} we only have to check 9, 10, 11, and 12.  (The multiplication by $13-n$ is justified since we have already know that $n$ is less than 13).  We find that when $n=\\boxed{12},$ the expression equals 13.", "gptanswer": " Since $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is always divisible by $13-n$, we can see that $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is always divisible by $12$. Since $12$ is a prime number, we can see that $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is always a prime number if and only if $n$ is a multiple of $6$. We can see that $n$ is a multiple of $6$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2$ if and only if $n$ is even. We can see that $n$ is even if and only if $n$ is divisible by $4$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $4$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^2$ if and only if $n$ is even and divisible by $4$. We can see that $n$ is even and divisible by $4$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^4$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^4$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2 \\cdot 4$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^2 \\cdot 4$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^4 - 1$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^4 - 1$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2 - 1$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^2 - 1$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 1$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 1$ if and only if $n$ is even and divisible by $2^2 + 1$. We can see that $n$ is even and divisible by $2^2 + 1$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 1 - 1$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 1 - 1$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 0$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 0$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 2^0$. We can see that $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 2^0$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2^2 + 2^1$.", "boxed": "nobox"}
