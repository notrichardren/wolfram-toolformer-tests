{"problem": "What is the greatest three-digit integer in which the product of the digits is 6?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "$6=1\\cdot1\\cdot6=1\\cdot2\\cdot3$. To find the greatest three-digit integer the product of whose digits is 6, maximize first the hundreds digit, then the tens digit, and finally the units digit. Of the nine such integers, $\\boxed{611}$ is the greatest.", "gptanswer": " Since $6=2^3$, we can take $3$-digit integers whose product of digits is $6$ by taking the cube root of $6$. The cube root of $6$ is $\\boxed{2}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
