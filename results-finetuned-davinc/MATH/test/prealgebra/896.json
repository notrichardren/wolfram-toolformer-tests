{"problem": "There is a number $C$. The number $C$ is a multiple of 7, but is NOT a multiple of 3. The number $C$ is greater than 20, but less than 30. What is this number $C$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "From the problem we can gather that $20<C<30$. Because $C$ is also a multiple of 7, that limits the possibilities for number $C$ down to 21 and 28. The last clue left states that number $C$ is also NOT a multiple of 3. Out of the two posibilities left, 21 is the only value that is also a multiple of 3, thus eliminating it from being number $C$. Thus, the number $C$ can only be $\\boxed{28}$.", "gptanswer": " [asy]\n\\begin{align*}\nC&\\ge 20\\\\\n&< 30\\\\\n&\\text{but}\\\\\n&\\text{not}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{3}\\\\\n&\\text{and}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{7}\\\\\n&\\text{so}\\\\\n&\\text{it must be}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{11}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{13}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{17}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{19}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{23}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{29}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{31}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{37}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{41}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{43}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{47}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{53}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{59}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{61}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{67}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{71}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{73}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{79}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a multiple of}\\\\\n&\\text{83}\\\\\n&\\text{or}\\\\\n&\\text{a", "boxed": "nobox"}
