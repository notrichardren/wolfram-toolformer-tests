{"problem": "The measures of the sides of a triangle are 7, 24 and 25. What is the area of the triangle?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "We notice that $7^2+24^2=49+576=625$. Since $7^2+24^2=25^2$, the side lengths 7, 24, and 25 are the side lengths of a right triangle with legs 7 and 24 units, and hypotenuse 25 units. Thus, we can find the area of the triangle by multiplying $1/2$ by the product of lengths of the bases to get $(1/2)(7)(24)=7\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{84}$ square units.", "gptanswer": " Since the measures of the sides are 7, 24 and 25, the sides are in the ratio of $7:24:25$. Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+24+25=42$, and the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(42)=21$. The answer should be $\\boxed{21}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
