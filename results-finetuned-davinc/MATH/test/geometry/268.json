{"problem": "Let $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ be the degree measures of the five angles of a pentagon.  Suppose $v<w<x<y<z$ and $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ form an arithmetic sequence. Find the value of $x$.", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "A pentagon can be partitioned into three triangles, so the sum of the degree measures of the angles of the pentagon is $$\nv+w+x+y+z=540.\n$$The arithmetic sequence can be expressed as $x-2d$, $x-d$, $x$, $x+d$, and $x+2d$, where $d$ is the common difference, so $$\n(x-2d)+(x-d)+x+(x+d)+(x+2d)=5x=540.\n$$Thus, $x=\\boxed{108}$.", "gptanswer": " Since $v<w<x<y<z$, $v+w+x+y+z<5+5+6+7=25$.  Since $v,w,x,y,z$ form an arithmetic sequence, $v+w=x+y$ and $w+x=z+y$.  Hence $2+3=1+6$ and $3+6=4+7$, so $x=1$ and $z=4$.  Since $v<w<x<y<z$, $v+z<w+y$ and $v+y<x+z$.  Hence $2+4<3+6$ and $2+6<1+3$, so $x+z<1+3$.  Hence $1+3<4+1$, so $x+z<5+4=9$.  Hence $x<9-1=\\boxed{8}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
