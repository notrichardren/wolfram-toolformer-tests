{"problem": "The ratio of two interior angles of a parallelogram is $4:5$. What is the degree measure of one of the two obtuse angles of the parallelogram?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "If the measures of these two interior angles are $x$ and $y$, then $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{4}{5}$ and therefore $5x=4y$. We also know that $x+y=180$, so therefore $4x+4y=720$, $9x=720$, and $x=80$. Therefore, $y = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 80 = \\boxed{100^\\circ}$.", "gptanswer": " Since the sum of the measures of the two acute angles of a parallelogram is $180^\\circ$, the measure of one of the obtuse angles of the parallelogram is $180^\\circ - 4^\\circ - 5^\\circ = \\boxed{155^\\circ}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
