========[PROMPT: Solve the Problem | No Wolfram]========

[Problem] (copy/paste)

Please solve the problem above as accurately as possible. Your final answer should be boxed in LaTeX. Please only put a mathematical expression or number in the boxed answer; leave out text of any form like names or natural language. 

The answer in the box should not have any text unless it is a multiple choice question. For example, boxing "the answer is 2" is not acceptable; boxing "2" is. Boxing "A" for a multiple choice output is also acceptable. It should also not contain the name of the variable. For instance, "x=2" is not acceptable; boxing "2" is.

========[PROMPT: Wolfram Query | Wolfram Pt 1]========

[Problem] (copy/paste)

Above is a math problem. Please give me a proper query to put into Wolfram Alpha Simple API to solve this problem. 

Make the query as simple as possible, and only use numbers and mathematical expressions (not names, words, or natural language). Furthermore, do not use LaTeX to write mathematical expressions as an input to Wolfram. Write your expression as simply as possible. It must be parasable by the Wolfram Alpha Simple API.
