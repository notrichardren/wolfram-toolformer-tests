{"problem": "Janaina is trying to solve the following equation by completing the square: $$x^2+18x-9 = 0.$$She successfully rewrites the above equation in the following form: $$(x + b)^2 = c,$$where $b$ and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $c$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "We rewrite the equation as follows, trying to create a square of a binomial on the left side: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 + 18x - 9 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 + 18x + 81 &= 90\\\\\n(x + 9)^2 &= 90.\n\\end{align*}We see that this clearly works, and $c = \\boxed{90}.$", "gptanswer": " We can see that $c = \\sqrt{18}$ satisfies the equation. The only two integers between 1 and 19 that satisfy this equation are $2$ and $\\sqrt{18}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
