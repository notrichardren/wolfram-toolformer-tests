{"problem": "Suppose $c$ and $d$ are inversely proportional. If $c=9$ when $d=8$, find the value of $d$ when $c=6$.", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "If $c$ and $d$ are inversely proportional, then $c\\cdot{d}=k$ (where $k$ is a constant). We know that $c=9$ when $d=8$, so $(9)(8)=k$ or $k=72$. When $c=6$, $(6)(d)=72$.  Thus, $d$ must be equal to $\\frac{72}{6}$ or $\\boxed{12}$.", "gptanswer": " Since $c=9$ when $d=8$, $c/d=9/8=1.125$. Since $c=6$ when $d=?,$ $c/d=6/d=6/d=1/d$. Since $d$ and $c$ are inversely proportional, $d$ and $1/d$ are also inversely proportional. So, $d/1/d=1/d$ or $d=\\boxed{1}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
