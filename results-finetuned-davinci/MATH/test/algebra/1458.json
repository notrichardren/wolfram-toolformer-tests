{"problem": "The expression $6y^2-y-51$ can be rewritten as $(3Ay+B)(y-C)$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are positive integers. Find $(AC)^2-B$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The expression $6y^2-y-51$ can be rewritten as $(6y+17)(y-3)$. Therefore, $A=2$, $B=17$, and $C=3$. Thus, $(AC)^2-B=(2\\times3)^2-17=\\boxed{19}$.", "gptanswer": " We can rewrite $6y^2-y-51$ as $(3Ay+B)(y-C)$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{6y^2-y-51}{3Ay} &= \\frac{(3Ay+B)(y-C)}{Ay} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(3Ay+B)(y-C)}{Ay} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3Ay+B}{Ay}(y-C) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-C) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3Ay) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3)(A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3)(A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2)(A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3)(A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3A+2B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3A+2)(A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3A+2A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3A+2A+3B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3A+2A+3)(A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3A+2A+3A+2A+3A+B) \\\\\n&= 3Ay+B(y-3A)(A+3", "boxed": "nobox"}
