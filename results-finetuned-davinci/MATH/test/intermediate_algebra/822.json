{"problem": "What is the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is the magnitude of their difference. Therefore our distance is $|(5+6i)-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "gptanswer": " The complex numbers $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$ are $\\boxed{\\left(3+4i, -1-2i\\right)}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
