{"problem": "Find the quotient when $x^6 - 3$ is divided by $x + 1.$", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "We can perform long division.  Alternatively, by the Remainder Theorem, the remainder upon division is $(-1)^6 - 3 = -2.$  Thus, we can write\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x^6 - 3}{x + 1} &= \\frac{(x^6 - 1) - 2}{x + 1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{x^6 - 1}{x + 1} - \\frac{2}{x + 1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1)}{x + 1} - \\frac{2}{x + 1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(x^3 - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}{x + 1} - \\frac{2}{x + 1} \\\\\n&= (x^3 - 1)(x^2 - x + 1) - \\frac{2}{x + 1} \\\\\n&= x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the quotient is $\\boxed{x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1}.$", "gptanswer": " We have $x^6 - 3 = (x^5) - 3 = x^5 + 3 = x^5 + x + 1.$ We want to divide by $x + 1,$ so we want to find the inverse of $x + 1.$ We have that $x + 1 = \\frac{1}{x} + 1.$ We can now find the inverse of $x + 1$ by taking the reciprocal and adding $1.$ We have that $1 + 1 = 2,$ so the inverse of $x + 1$ is $x + 1 = \\boxed{2}.$", "boxed": "boxed"}
