{"problem": "The fourth term of a geometric series is $24$ and the eleventh term is $3072$. What is the common ratio?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term and $r$ be the common ratio. Then we have, $ar^3 = 24$ and $ar^{10} = 3072$.  Dividing gives us\n$$r^7 = \\frac{3072}{24} = 128$$which means $r = \\boxed{2}.$", "gptanswer": " Since $1+2+4+8+16+\\cdots = \\frac{1}{2}(2+\\frac{1}{2})$, the common ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
