{"problem": "What is the value of the following expression: $100 - 99 +98 - 97 + 96 - 95 + \\cdots + 4 - 3 +2 - 1$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Each pair of consecutive terms makes 1 (for example, $100-99=1$). Since there are $100/2=50$ such pairs, the entire expression is equal to $1\\cdot50=\\boxed{50}$.", "gptanswer": " The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $2^n - 1$. Therefore, the sum of the first $100$ odd numbers is $2^{100} - 1 = \\boxed{65}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
