{"problem": "Factor $7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x$.", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Both 7 and $x$ are factors of each term, so we can factor out $7x$: \\[7x^3 -21x^2 + 14x = (7x)\\cdot(x^2) - (7x)\\cdot (3x) + (7x)\\cdot 2 = 7x(x^2 - 3x + 2).\\]We can factor $x^2 - 3x + 2$ into $(x-1)(x-2)$, to get our answer of $\\boxed{7x(x-1)(x-2)}$.", "gptanswer": " We factor $7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x$ as $(7x^2 - 14x)(x^2 + 7x)$. We can see that $7x^2 - 14x$ is a perfect square, so it factors into $7x(x - 2)$. We can see that $x^2 + 7x$ is also a perfect square, so it factors into $(x + 3)(x - 1)$. We can see that $7x(x - 2)$ and $(x + 3)(x - 1)$ are both pairs of binomials, so we can combine them into a binomial square factorization. We get $7x(x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 1)$, which factors into $x^2 - 5x + 6x - 1$. We can see that $x^2 - 5x + 6x - 1$ is a perfect square, so it factors into $x(x - 3)(x + 2)$. We can see that $x - 3$ and $x + 2$ are both linear factors, so we can combine them into a linear factorization. We get $x(x - 3)(x + 2) = (x - 1)(x + 3)$, which factors into $x^2 - 1$. We can see that $x^2 - 1$ is a perfect square, so it factors into $x(x - 1)$. We can see that $x - 1$ is a linear factor, so we can combine it into a linear factorization. We get $x(x - 1) = x - 1$, which factors into $1 - 1 = 0$. We can see that $0$ is a linear factor, so we can combine it into a linear factorization. We get $0 = 0$, which is the answer.", "boxed": "nobox"}
