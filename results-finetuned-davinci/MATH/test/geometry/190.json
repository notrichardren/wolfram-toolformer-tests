{"problem": "A right circular cylinder with radius 2 inches and height 1 inch has the same volume as a second right circular cylinder. The radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch. How many inches are in the height of the second cylinder?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "Let the second cylinder have height $h$ inches.  Setting the two volumes equal we have $\\pi(2^2)(1)=\\pi(1^2)(h) \\Rightarrow h = \\boxed{4}$ inches.", "gptanswer": " Since the radius of the first cylinder is 2 inches, the radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch. Since the volume of the first cylinder is the same as the second cylinder, the height of the first cylinder is 1 inch.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,1)--(0,1));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1));\n\nlabel(\"$x$\", (0,0), S);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (1,0), E);\nlabel(\"$V$\", (2,0), N);\nlabel(\"$V'$\", (1,1), S);\n[/asy]\n\nSince the radius of the first cylinder is 2 inches, the radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch.
