{"problem": "A right square pyramid has a base with edges each measuring 3 cm and a height twice the perimeter of its base. What is the volume of the pyramid?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The perimeter of the base is $4\\cdot 3 = 12$ cm, so the height of the pyramid is $2\\cdot 12 = 24$ cm.  The base has area $3^2 = 9$ square cm.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $9\\cdot 24/3=\\boxed{72}$ cubic cm.", "gptanswer": " Since the height of the pyramid is twice the perimeter of its base, the pyramid is a right square pyramid. Since the pyramid is a right square pyramid, the base is a square and the height is a diagonal of the square base. Since the height is a diagonal of the square base, the area of the square base is one half the area of the diagonal. Since the area of the square base is one half the area of the diagonal, the area of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the area of the square base. Since the area of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the area of the square base, the length of the diagonal is 2 times the length of the side of the square base. Since the length of the diagonal is 2 times the length of the side of the square base, the pyramid is a square pyramid. Since the pyramid is a square pyramid, the volume of the pyramid is one half the volume of a square based pyramid whose base is twice the size of the base of the given pyramid. Since the volume of the pyramid is one half the volume of a square based pyramid whose base is twice the size of the base of the given pyramid, the volume of the given pyramid is one half the volume of a square based pyramid whose base has sides measuring 3 cm and whose height is 4 cm. Since the volume of the pyramid is one half the volume of a square based pyramid whose base has sides measuring 3 cm and whose height is 4 cm, the volume of the given pyramid is $\\boxed{1\\frac{cm}{2}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
