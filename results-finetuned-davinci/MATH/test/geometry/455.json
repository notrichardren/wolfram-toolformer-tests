{"problem": "For a particular circle, a central angle of $75^{\\circ}$ will intercept an arc of length $10\\pi$ feet. What is the radius of this circle?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "A central angle of $75^\\circ$ cuts off an arc that is $\\frac{75}{360} = \\frac{5}{24}$ of the circumference of the circle.  Since $\\frac{5}{24}$ of the circle's circumference is $10\\pi$, the entire circumference of the circle is  $10\\pi \\cdot \\frac{24}{5} = 48\\pi$.  Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 48, and the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{24}$.", "gptanswer": " Since the central angle of $75^{\\circ}$ intercepts an arc of length $10\\pi$ feet, the angle subtends a portion of the circle equal to $10\\pi/360 = \\boxed{33.3}$ degrees. Since the circle has a radius of $r=\\sqrt{33.3^2+1^2}=\\boxed{5}$, the answer is $\\boxed{r=5}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
