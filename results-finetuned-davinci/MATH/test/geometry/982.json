{"problem": "What is the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles of a triangle if two of the interior angles have measures of 63 and 78 degrees?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The exterior angles of a triangle sum to $360^\\circ$, so the average of their measures is $360^\\circ/3 = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.", "gptanswer": " Since two of the interior angles have measures of 63 and 78 degrees, the sum of the measures of the three exterior angles is 180 degrees. Since the sum of the measures of the exterior angles is 180 degrees and two of the exterior angles have measures of 63 and 78 degrees, the third exterior angle must have a measure of $\\boxed{5}$ degrees.", "boxed": "boxed"}
