{"problem": "An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "Each ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (1^3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches.  The ice cream cone holds $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (2^2)(5) = \\frac{20}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches.  $\\frac{\\frac{20}{3}\\pi}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi} = 5$, so we need $\\boxed{5}$ scoops to fill the cone.", "gptanswer": " Since the cone has radius 2 and height 5, its volume is $\\frac{5}{3} \\pi^2 = 25 \\pi^3$.  The radius of the ice cream scoop is 1, so the volume of ice cream scoop is $1 \\pi^3$.  If $n$ scoops are used, then the amount of ice cream scoop used is $n \\pi^3$.  The volume of ice cream scoop that melts into the cone is $1-\\pi^3$.  Therefore, the amount of ice cream scoop that does not melt into the cone is $n-\\pi^3$.  The volume of ice cream scoop is $1 \\pi^3 = n \\pi^3$, so $n-\\pi^3 = n \\cdot \\pi^3 = n(2 \\pi^3) = 2 \\cdot 25 \\pi^3 = \\boxed{50}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
