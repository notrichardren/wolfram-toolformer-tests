{"problem": "Find the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line $x+ y= 6$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The region bounded by these lines is a right-isosceles triangle with legs along the $x$ and $y$ axes.  The length of these legs are given by the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line which are both 6.  Thus the area of this region is $\\frac 12 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ square units.", "gptanswer": " Since $x+y=6$, $x=6-y$.  We are asked to find the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line $x+y=6$.  Since the $x$-axis is a $y$-axis, the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis is the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis.  Since the $x$-axis is a $y$-axis, the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis and the line $x+y=6$ is the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis and the line $x+y=6$.  Since $x+y=6$, $x=6-y=0$.  We are asked to find the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line $x+y=6$.
