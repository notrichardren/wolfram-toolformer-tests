{"problem": "Solve for $k$ in the equation $2k+5 = 13$.", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "Subtracting 5 from both sides gives $2k = 8$ and dividing by 2 gives $k = \\boxed{4}$.", "gptanswer": " We can factor $2k+5$ as $(2k)(k+5)$. We can also factor $13$ as $(3)(4)$. We can now pair up $(2k+5)(3)(4)$ and $(2k)(k+5)$ to get $(6)(5)$ and $(2)(6)$, respectively. We can now divide $6$ by $2$ to get $\\boxed{3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
