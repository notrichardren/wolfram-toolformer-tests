{"problem": "What is the 2004th positive odd integer?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The first positive odd integer is 1.  To get to the 2004th positive odd integer, we must add 2 exactly 2003 times.  Make sure you see why it's not 2004 times -- that would give us the 2005th positive odd integer, just like adding one 2 to 1 gives us the second positive odd integer, not the first.  Therefore, our answer is $1 + 2003\\cdot 2 = \\boxed{4007}$.", "gptanswer": " [asy]\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{2004th positive odd integer} &= 2^2 + 1 \\\\\n&= 2\\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\\\\n&= 2^1\\cdot 2 + 1 \\\\\n&= 2^0\\cdot 2 + 1 \\\\\n&= 2 + 1 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{3}.\n\\end{align*}[/asy]", "boxed": "boxed"}
