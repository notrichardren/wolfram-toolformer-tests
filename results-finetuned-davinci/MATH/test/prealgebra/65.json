{"problem": "Let $N$ be the units digit of the number $21420N$. Which nonzero value of $N$ makes this number divisible by $6$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The number $21420N$ is divisible by $6$ if and only if it is even and the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. So $N$ must be even, and $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$ must be divisible by $3$.  Since $9$ is divisible by $3$, we see that $N$ must also be divisible by $3$. The only digit that works is $N = \\boxed{6}$.", "gptanswer": " Since $21420N$ is divisible by $2$, we know that $21420N = 2^N \\cdot 10^6$. Since $N$ is the units digit of $21420N$, $N$ must be a multiple of $10$. Since $6$ is not a multiple of $10$, $N$ cannot be $6$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
