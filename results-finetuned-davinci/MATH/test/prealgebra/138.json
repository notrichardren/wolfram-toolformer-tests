{"problem": "What is the positive difference between the greatest and least prime factors of 2000?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The prime factorization of 2000 is $2^4 \\times 5^3$ (build a factor tree if you need to see it). The greatest prime factor is 5 and the smallest prime factor is 2.  The difference is $5-2=\\boxed{3}$.", "gptanswer": " Since 2000 has two factors, the prime factors must be greater than 2. The first prime factor of 2000 is $2^4=16$. The second prime factor of 2000 is $2^2\\cdot3=12$. The positive difference between the greatest and least prime factors of 2000 is $16-12=4$. The answer is $\\boxed{4}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
