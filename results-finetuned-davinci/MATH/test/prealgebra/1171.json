{"problem": "What is the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "One interior angle of an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees while one interior angle of a square measures 90 degrees. The ratio is $60/90=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.", "gptanswer": " Since the three angles of an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees, one angle of a square is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an angle of an equilateral triangle. Thus, the ratio of one angle of a square to one angle of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{1}{4} : 1 = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{1}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
