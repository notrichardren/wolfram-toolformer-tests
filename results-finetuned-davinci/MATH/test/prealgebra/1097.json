{"problem": "What is the least common multiple of 72 and 96?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "Prime factorize 72 as $2^3\\cdot 3^2$ and 96 as $2^5\\cdot 3$.  The exponent of 2 in any common multiple of 72 and 96 must be at least 5, and the exponent of 3 must be at least 2.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 72 and 96 is $2^5\\cdot 3^2=\\boxed{288}$.", "gptanswer": " Since $72=2^3\\cdot3$ and $96=2^4\\cdot6$, the least common multiple of $72$ and $96$ is $2^3\\cdot3\\cdot2^4\\cdot6=2^9\\cdot6=\\boxed{132}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
