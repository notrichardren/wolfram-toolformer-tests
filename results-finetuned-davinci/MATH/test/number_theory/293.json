{"problem": "What digit must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer $20\\_7$ a multiple of 11?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work.", "gptanswer": " Since $20\\_7 = 2\\cdot10\\_7 + 8\\_7$, we can see that $8\\_7$ must be a multiple of 11. Since $8\\_7 = 8\\cdot\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{7}$, we can see that $\\frac{1}{7}$ must be a multiple of 11. Since $\\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{7}{11} - \\frac{1}{11}$, we can see that $7/11$ must be a multiple of 11. Since $7/11 = 7\\cdot\\frac{1}{11} + \\frac{1}{11}$, we can see that $\\frac{1}{11}$ must be a multiple of 11. Since $\\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} - \\frac{1}{11}$, we can see that $11/11$ must be a multiple of 11. Since $11/11 = 11\\cdot0$, we can see that 0 must be a multiple of 11. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
