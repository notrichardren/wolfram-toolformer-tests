{"problem": "How many of the first one hundred positive integers are divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5?$", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "We could do this by the divisibility rules, but that would be quite tedious. It's easier to note that a number divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$. This is because a number which is divisible by several integers must be divisible by their least common multiple -- however, since $3, 4,$ and $5$ are relatively prime, the least common multiple is just the product of all three. Clearly, there is only one number between $1$ and $100$ divisible by $60;$ that is, $60$ itself. Thus there is only $\\boxed{1}$ such number.", "gptanswer": " There are $100!$ ways to choose $3$ things from $100$ things. Of these $100!$ combinations, $3!$ of them have all three divisors being $3, 4,$ and $5$. Thus, the number of combinations with all three divisors being $3, 4,$ and $5$ is $\\boxed{3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
