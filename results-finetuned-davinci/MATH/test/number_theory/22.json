{"problem": "The two-digit number $``B6,''$ where $B$ is the tens digit, is the square of a positive integer. How many distinct possible values are there for $B$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Of the two-digit perfect squares, only $4^2=16$ and $6^2=36$ end in $6$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct possible values for $B$.", "gptanswer": " Since $B6 = (B^2)^2 = B^4,$ the possible values for $B$ are $1,2,3,4.$ There are $\\boxed{4}$ distinct possible values for $B.$", "boxed": "boxed"}
