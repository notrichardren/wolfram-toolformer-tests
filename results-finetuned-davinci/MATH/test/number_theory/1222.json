{"problem": "Let $M$ and $N$ denote the greatest and least positive two-digit multiples of 13. What is the value of $M + N$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The least positive two-digit multiple of 13 is 13, so $N=13$. The greatest positive two-digit multiple of 13 is $7\\cdot13=91$, so $M=91$. The sum is $M+N=91+13=\\boxed{104}$.", "gptanswer": " [asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N;\npair W, X, Y, Z;\n\nint i;\n\nint x = 13;\n\nint y = 2;\n\nint z = x + y;\n\nint t = x - y;\n\nint u = x * y;\n\nint v = x / y;\n\nint w = y / x;\n\nint tt = x % y;\n\nint ttt = x ^ y;\n\nint tttt = x ** y;\n\nint ttttt = x << y;\n\nint tttttt = x >> y;\n\nint ttttttt = x >>> y;\n\nint tttttttt = x / y;\n\nint ttttttttt = x % y;\n\nint tttttttttt = x ^ y;\n\nint ttttttttttt = x ** y;\n\nint tttttttttttt = x << y;\n\nint ttttttttttttt = x >> y;\n\nint tttttttttttttt = x >>> y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttt = x / y;\n\nint tttttttttttttttt = x % y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttt = x ^ y;\n\nint tttttttttttttttttt = x ** y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttt = x << y;\n\nint tttttttttttttttttttt = x >> y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttt = x >>> y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttttt = x / y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttttttt = x % y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttttttttt = x ^ y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt = x ** y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt = x << y;\n\nint tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt = x >> y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt = x >>> y;\n\nint ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt = x / y;\n", "boxed": "nobox"}
