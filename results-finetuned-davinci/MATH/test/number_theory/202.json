{"problem": "What is the units digit of $19^{19}+99^{99}$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The units digit of a power of an integer is determined by the units digit of the integer; that is, the tens digit, hundreds digit, etc... of the integer have no effect on the units digit of the result. In this problem, the units digit of $19^{19}$ is the units digit of $9^{19}$. Note that $9^1=9$ ends in 9, $9^2=81$ ends in 1, $9^3=729$ ends in 9, and, in general, the units digit of odd powers of 9 is 9, whereas the units digit of even powers of 9 is 1. Since both exponents are odd, the sum of their units digits is $9+9=18$, the units digit of which is $\\boxed{8}.$", "gptanswer": " The units digit of $19^{19}+99^{99}$ is the units digit of $19^{18}+99^{98}$, which is the units digit of $19^{17}+99^{97}$, which is the units digit of $19^{16}+99^{96}$, which is the units digit of $19^{15}+99^{95}$, which is the units digit of $19^{14}+99^{94}$, which is the units digit of $19^{13}+99^{93}$, which is the units digit of $19^{12}+99^{92}$, which is the units digit of $19^{11}+99^{91}$, which is the units digit of $19^{10}+99^{90}$, which is 1. So the units digit of $19^{19}+99^{99}$ is $\\boxed{1}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
