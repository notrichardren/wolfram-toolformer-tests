{"problem": "What value of $k$ makes the positive five-digit integer $k3,\\!57k$ divisible by 18?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Since $18=2\\cdot 3^2$, an integer is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  For $k3,\\!57k$ to be divisible by 2, $k$ must be even.  To determine whether $k3,\\!57k$ is divisible by 9, we find the sum of its digits, which is $2k+15$.  Substituting $k=0,2,4,\\ldots$, we find that none of the numbers 15, 19, or 23 are divisible by 9, but $15+2(6)=27$ is divisible by 9.  Therefore, $k=\\boxed{6}$.", "gptanswer": " Since $18=2^3\\cdot3$, we can try $k=2^a\\cdot3$, for some integer $a$. We can try $a=1,\\!2,\\!3$.\n\nIf $a=1$, then $k3,\\!57k=2^1\\cdot3\\cdot57=2^{57}\\cdot3=2^{191}3=\\boxed{65,531}$.\n\nIf $a=2$, then $k3,\\!57k=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot57=2^{57}\\cdot3=2^{189}3=\\boxed{63,721}$.\n\nIf $a=3$, then $k3,\\!57k=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot57=2^{57}\\cdot3=2^{171}3=\\boxed{60,937}$.\n\nSince $\\boxed{60,937}$ is the smallest positive five-digit integer that is divisible by 18, $k=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{18}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
