{"problem": "If $60$ miles per hour is $88$ feet per second, how many feet per second is $66$ miles per hour? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "We have $60 \\text{ miles per hour} = 88 \\text{ feet per second}$. Multiplying both sides by $66/60$, we have $66 \\text{ miles per hour} = \\frac{66}{60} \\cdot 88 \\text{ feet per second} = \\boxed{96.8} \\text{ feet per second}$.", "gptanswer": "We have that $60$ miles per hour is $88$ feet per second. Therefore, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = \\frac{88 \\text{ feet}}{1 \\text{ second}}$. To find how many feet per second is $66$ miles per hour, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{66 \\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = \\frac{x \\text{ feet}}{1 \\text{ second}}$, where $x$ is the number of feet per second. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{66 \\cdot 88}{60} \\approx \\boxed{96.8}$ feet per second.", "boxed": "boxed"}
