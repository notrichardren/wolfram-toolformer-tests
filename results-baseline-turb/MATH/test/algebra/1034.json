{"problem": "If $A$, $B$ and $C$ are positive integers such that $\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}$, what is the value of $A+B+C$ given that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, and $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the right hand side of the given equation by $\\sqrt{3}$, we have \\[\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C}=\\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{6}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] Thus, $A=3$, $B=3$, and $C=2$, so $A+B+C=3+3+2=\\boxed{8}$.", "gptanswer": "We begin by simplifying the given equation: $$\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\Rightarrow \\frac{2A\\sqrt{3}}{C} = 9\\sqrt{\\frac{B}{3}}.$$Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we must have $\\frac{B}{3}$ as a perfect square. Let $\\frac{B}{3} = k^2$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, we have $$\\frac{2A\\sqrt{3}}{C} = 9k \\Rightarrow \\frac{4A^2 \\cdot 3}{C^2} = 81k^2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{A^2 \\cdot 3}{C^2} = 27k^2.$$Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, we must have $C^2 = 3$ and $A^2 = 27k^2$. Thus, $C = \\sqrt{3}$ and $A = 3k\\sqrt{3}$. Substituting these values back into the original equation, we get $$\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\Rightarrow \\frac{3k\\sqrt{3} \\cdot k\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\Rightarrow k^2 = \\frac{1}{2}.$$Since $k$ is a positive integer, we must have $k = 1$. Therefore, $B = 3$ and $A = 3\\sqrt{3}$, and $C = \\sqrt{3}$. Thus, $A+B+C = 3\\sqrt{3} + 3 + \\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3} + 3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
