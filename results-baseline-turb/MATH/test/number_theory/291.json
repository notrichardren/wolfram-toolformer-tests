{"problem": "Let $N$ be the product of all integers from 1 through 10 that are not divisible by 5. What is the units digit of $N$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "$N=1\\times2\\times3\\times4\\times6\\times7\\times8\\times9$. We find the units digit of $N$ by disregarding the other digits as we progressively multiply: the units digit of $1\\times2$ is 2; the units digit of $2\\times3$ is 6; the units digit of $6\\times4$ is 4; the units digit of $4\\times6$ is 4; the units digit of $4\\times7$ is 8; the units digit of $8\\times8$ is 4; finally, the units digit of $4\\times9$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{6}$.", "gptanswer": "We can write $N$ as the product of all integers from 1 through 10, and then divide out the factors of 5: $$N = (1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot2)\\div5 = 2^3\\cdot3^2\\cdot7\\cdot\\boxed{2}.$$Therefore, the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{2}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
