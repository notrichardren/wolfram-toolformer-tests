{"problem": "On a Tuesday, a magician said, ``I made my wife disappear 31 days ago.'' What day of the week did he make her disappear?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Since $31 \\equiv 3$ (mod 7), he made his wife disappear 3 days before a Tuesday, or $\\boxed{\\mbox{Saturday}}$.", "gptanswer": "We know that 31 is congruent to 3 modulo 7 (since 31 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3). This means that if the wife disappeared on a Tuesday, then 3 days later (on Friday) would be a multiple of 7 days later, so it would also be a Tuesday. Therefore, the wife disappeared on a $\\boxed{\\text{Friday}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
