{"problem": "What is the units digit of $19^{19}+99^{99}$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The units digit of a power of an integer is determined by the units digit of the integer; that is, the tens digit, hundreds digit, etc... of the integer have no effect on the units digit of the result. In this problem, the units digit of $19^{19}$ is the units digit of $9^{19}$. Note that $9^1=9$ ends in 9, $9^2=81$ ends in 1, $9^3=729$ ends in 9, and, in general, the units digit of odd powers of 9 is 9, whereas the units digit of even powers of 9 is 1. Since both exponents are odd, the sum of their units digits is $9+9=18$, the units digit of which is $\\boxed{8}.$", "gptanswer": "We can find the units digit of $19^{19}$ and $99^{99}$ separately and then add them. \n\nTo find the units digit of $19^{19}$, we can look for a pattern in the units digits of the powers of 19: \n\n\\begin{align*}\n19^1 &= 9 \\\\\n19^2 &= 1 \\\\\n19^3 &= 9 \\\\\n19^4 &= 1 \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n19^{18} &= 1 \\\\\n19^{19} &= 9 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the units digit of $19^{19}$ is 9. \n\nTo find the units digit of $99^{99}$, we can also look for a pattern: \n\n\\begin{align*}\n99^1 &= 9 \\\\\n99^2 &= 1 \\\\\n99^3 &= 9 \\\\\n99^4 &= 1 \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n99^{98} &= 1 \\\\\n99^{99} &= 9 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the units digit of $99^{99}$ is also 9. \n\nAdding the units digits of $19^{19}$ and $99^{99}$, we get $9+9=\\boxed{8}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
