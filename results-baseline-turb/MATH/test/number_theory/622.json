{"problem": "What value of $k$ makes the positive five-digit integer $k3,\\!57k$ divisible by 18?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Since $18=2\\cdot 3^2$, an integer is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  For $k3,\\!57k$ to be divisible by 2, $k$ must be even.  To determine whether $k3,\\!57k$ is divisible by 9, we find the sum of its digits, which is $2k+15$.  Substituting $k=0,2,4,\\ldots$, we find that none of the numbers 15, 19, or 23 are divisible by 9, but $15+2(6)=27$ is divisible by 9.  Therefore, $k=\\boxed{6}$.", "gptanswer": "For a number to be divisible by 18, it must be divisible by both 9 and 2. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Thus, we have $k+3+5+7+k\\equiv 2k+15\\equiv 0\\pmod{9}$. Simplifying, we get $2k\\equiv 6\\pmod{9}$, which implies $k\\equiv 3\\pmod{9}$. \n\nA number is divisible by 2 if and only if its units digit is even. Thus, $k$ must be even. \n\nCombining the two conditions, we have $k\\equiv 6\\pmod{9}$ and $k\\equiv 0\\pmod{2}$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions is $\\boxed{54}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
