{"problem": "Three-fourths of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair and six-sevenths of his students are right-handed.  If Mr. Shearer's class has 28 students, what is the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "Mr. Shearer has $\\frac{3}{4}(28)=21$ students with brown hair and $\\frac{6}{7}(28)=24$ students who are right-handed.  Since there are $28-24=4$ left-handed students, at most 4 of the 21 brown-haired students are left-handed.  Therefore, at least $\\boxed{17}$ of them are right-handed.", "gptanswer": "There are 21 students with brown hair and 24 students who are right-handed. To find the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair, we need to find the smallest possible common multiple of 4 and 7 that is less than or equal to 28. The common multiples of 4 and 7 are 28, 56, 84, etc. The smallest one that is less than or equal to 28 is 28. Therefore, the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is $\\boxed{21}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
