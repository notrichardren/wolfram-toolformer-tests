{"problem": "In the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10, what is the next number?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "The row that starts 1, 10 is the row $\\binom{10}{0}, \\binom{10}{1}, \\binom{10}{2},\\ldots$, so the next number is $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2\\cdot 1} = \\boxed{45}$.", "gptanswer": "The row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10 is 1, 11, 55, 165, 330, 462, 462, 330, 165, 55, 11, 1. Therefore, the next number is $\\boxed{1}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
