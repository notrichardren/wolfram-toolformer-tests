{"problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and they are multiplied. What is the probability that the product is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ whose product is odd is $\\{1,3\\}$.  Since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\\{1,3\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\\dfrac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}}$.", "gptanswer": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. To get an odd product, both numbers must be odd. There are two odd numbers in the set, so there are $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ ways to choose two odd numbers. To get an even product, we can either choose an even number and an odd number or two even numbers. There are two even numbers in the set, so there are $\\binom{2}{1}=2$ ways to choose one even number and one odd number. There is only one way to choose two even numbers. Therefore, there are $1+2+1=4$ ways to choose two numbers whose product is even. The probability of choosing two numbers whose product is even is $\\dfrac{4}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
