{"problem": "Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$, or $\\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\\frac{1}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{18}}$.", "gptanswer": "[Solution] There are $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes when two dice are rolled. We can list all the possible outcomes and count the number of outcomes where the sum is between 3 and 11, inclusive. However, this is a bit tedious, so we will use a different approach.\n\nLet $S$ be the sum of the two numbers showing on the dice. We want to find $P(3 \\leq S \\leq 11)$. Note that $S$ can take on any value between 2 (when both dice show a 1) and 12 (when both dice show a 6). Since the dice are fair, each value of $S$ between 2 and 12 is equally likely. Therefore, we can find $P(3 \\leq S \\leq 11)$ by finding the probability of all the values of $S$ that are not between 3 and 11, and subtracting that from 1.\n\nThe values of $S$ that are not between 3 and 11 are 2 and 12. The probability of rolling a 2 is $\\frac{1}{36}$, since there is only one way to roll a 2 (both dice show a 1), out of 36 possible outcomes. Similarly, the probability of rolling a 12 is $\\frac{1}{36}$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a sum that is not between 3 and 11 is $\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\nSubtracting this from 1, we get:\n\n$$P(3 \\leq S \\leq 11) = 1 - \\frac{1}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{18}}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
