{"problem": "In how many ways can 13 students be selected from a group of 15 students to serve on a chalkboard-cleaning team?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "We can choose 13 students out of a group of 15 students without regard to order in $\\binom{15}{13} = \\boxed{105}$ ways.", "gptanswer": "There are $\\boxed{816}$ ways to select 13 students from a group of 15 students. \n\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula: \n\n$$\\binom{15}{13} = \\frac{15!}{13!2!} = \\frac{15\\times14}{2\\times1} = 105$$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that selecting 13 students is the same as not selecting 2 students, so the answer is:\n\n$$\\binom{15}{2} = \\frac{15!}{2!13!} = \\frac{15\\times14}{2\\times1} = 105$$\n\nEither way, the final answer is $\\boxed{105}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
