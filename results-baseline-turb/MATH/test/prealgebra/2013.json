{"problem": "Amy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy have $36$ apples that they plan to split among themselves in a ratio of $2:3:3:4$, respectively. How many apples will Betty and Cathy have together?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The four girls are dividing the $36$ apples into $2+3+3+4 = 12$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{36}{12} = 3$ apples per part. Together, Betty and Cathy have $3+3 = 6$ parts, so they will have $3 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ apples.", "gptanswer": "First, we add up the parts of the ratio to get $2+3+3+4=12$. This means that each part of the ratio represents $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the total. To find how many apples each person gets, we multiply their respective parts by the total number of apples: $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{Amy: }& 2\\cdot\\frac{36}{12}=6 \\\\ \\text{Betty: }& 3\\cdot\\frac{36}{12}=9 \\\\ \\text{Cathy: }& 3\\cdot\\frac{36}{12}=9 \\\\ \\text{Daisy: }& 4\\cdot\\frac{36}{12}=12 \\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, Betty and Cathy together have $9+9=\\boxed{18}$ apples.", "boxed": "boxed"}
