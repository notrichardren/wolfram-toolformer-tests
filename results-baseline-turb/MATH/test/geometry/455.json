{"problem": "For a particular circle, a central angle of $75^{\\circ}$ will intercept an arc of length $10\\pi$ feet. What is the radius of this circle?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "A central angle of $75^\\circ$ cuts off an arc that is $\\frac{75}{360} = \\frac{5}{24}$ of the circumference of the circle.  Since $\\frac{5}{24}$ of the circle's circumference is $10\\pi$, the entire circumference of the circle is  $10\\pi \\cdot \\frac{24}{5} = 48\\pi$.  Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 48, and the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{24}$.", "gptanswer": "We know that the length of an arc is given by $s=r\\theta$, where $s$ is the length of the arc, $r$ is the radius of the circle, and $\\theta$ is the central angle in radians. Since we are given the length of the arc and the measure of the central angle in degrees, we need to convert the angle to radians. We have:\n\n$$\\theta = 75^{\\circ} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180^{\\circ}} = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$$\n\nNow we can use the formula for the length of an arc to solve for the radius:\n\n$$10\\pi = r \\cdot \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$r = \\frac{10\\pi}{\\frac{5\\pi}{12}} = \\boxed{24}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
