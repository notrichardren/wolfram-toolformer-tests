The area of the four quarter-circles with radius 3 is equivalent to the area of one circle with radius 3, or $\\pi\\cdot3^{2}=9\\pi.$ So, the area of the shaded region is $36-9\\pi.$ Thus, $a=36$ and $b=9,$ so $a+b=\\boxed{45}.$", "gptanswer": "The area of the square is $6^2=36$ square units. The area of each quarter-circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\pi\\cdot3^2=\\frac{9}{4}\\pi$ square units. Since there are four quarter-circles, their combined area is $4\\cdot\\frac{9}{4}\\pi=9\\pi$ square units. However, we have overcounted the area of the four corners of the square, which are each part of two quarter-circles. The combined area of the corners is $4\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\pi\\cdot3^2=9\\pi$ square units. Therefore, the shaded area is $36-9\\pi+9\\pi=36$ square units. Thus, $a+b=36+0=\\boxed{36}.$", "boxed": "boxed"}
