{"problem": "Each edge of a cube has length 3 inches. What is the number of square inches in the cube's total surface area?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "Each face of the cube has area $3\\cdot3=9$ square inches. Since the cube's surface area includes 6 faces, the total surface area is $9\\cdot6=\\boxed{54}$ square inches.", "gptanswer": "[Solution] Each face of the cube has an area of $(3\\text{ in.})^2=9\\text{ in.}^2$. Since there are 6 faces in a cube, the total surface area of the cube is $6\\times 9\\text{ in.}^2=\\boxed{54}\\text{ in.}^2$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
