Please only put a mathematical expression or number in the boxed answer; leave out text of any form like names or natural language.\n\nThe answer in the box should not have any text unless it is a multiple choice question. For example, boxing \"the answer is 2\" is not acceptable; boxing \"2\" is. Boxing \"A\" for a multiple choice output is also acceptable. It should also not contain the name of the variable. For instance, \"x=2\" is not acceptable; boxing \"2\" is. It should should only contain the very final answer. For example, boxing \"2^2 + 1 = 5\" is not acceptable, but boxing \"5\" is.",

Please give me a proper query to put into Wolfram Alpha API to solve this problem.\n\nMake the query as simple as possible, and only use numbers and mathematical expressions (not names, words, or natural language). Furthermore, do not use LaTeX to write mathematical expressions as an input to Wolfram. Write your expression as simply as possible. It must be parasable by the Wolfram Alpha API. Start your query with \"Query:\" and do not surround it with quotation marks.",
