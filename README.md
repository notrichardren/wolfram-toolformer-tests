# wolfram-toolformer
A exploratory project to test out GPT's math ability when fine-tuned and augmented with the Wolfram Alpha API.

If you'd like to replicate our results, get your OpenAI & Wolfram API Keys and place them in keys.json. Do use them as well for any commands you may need to run (e.g. for results-finetuned-davinci.ipynb)
