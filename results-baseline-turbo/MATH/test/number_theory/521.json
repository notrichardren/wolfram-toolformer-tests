{"problem": "The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. What is the greater of the two integers?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "First we find the prime factorization of 288 to be $2^5\\cdot 3^2$, and we have to split these factors among two consecutive even integers. The 3 must be with at least one 2 for the integer to be even, meaning one of the factors must be a multiple of $6.$ After some playing around, we find that when one factor is 18, that leaves us with $2^4=16$. So, our two integers are 16 and 18, with the greater integer being $\\boxed{18}$.", "gptanswer": "We can solve the problem by using algebra. Let x be the smaller even integer, then the next consecutive even integer is x+2. We know that their product is 288, so we can write an equation:\n\nx(x+2) = 288\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nx^2 + 2x = 288\n\nMoving all the terms to one side, we get a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 288 = 0\n\nWe can solve for x by factoring or using the quadratic formula, but we notice that 18 is a factor of 288, so we can try to factor the quadratic equation as:\n\n(x+18)(x-16) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero, we get two solutions:\n\nx+18 = 0 or x-16 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = -18 or x = 16\n\nSince x is a positive even integer, the only solution is x = 16, which means the greater even integer is:\n\nx+2 = 16+2 = 18\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{18}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
