{"problem": "What is the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Dividing, we find that $11\\cdot 182=2002$.  Therefore, the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11 is $\\boxed{1}$.", "gptanswer": "We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For example, 209 is divisible by 11 because 2 - 0 + 9 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n\nApplying this rule to 2003, we get:\n\n2 - 0 + 0 - 3 = -1\n\nSince -1 is not divisible by 11, we know that 2003 is not divisible by 11. Therefore, the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11 is the same as the remainder when any number that is congruent to 2003 modulo 11 is divided by 11. In other words, we can subtract a multiple of 11 from 2003 until we get a number between 0 and 10, and that will be the remainder.\n\nTo find a number that is congruent to 2003 modulo 11, we can use the fact that 2000 is divisible by 11, so we have:\n\n2003 = 2000 + 3 \u2261 3 (mod 11)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11 is $\\boxed{3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
