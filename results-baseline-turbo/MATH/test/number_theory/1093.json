{"problem": "What is the remainder when $7438+7439+7440+7441+7442+7443+7444+7445$ is divided by $8$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Since $7438,7439,\\ldots,7445$ are $8$ consecutive integers, they include exactly one integer from each residue class $\\pmod 8$. Therefore, their sum is congruent $\\pmod 8$ to $0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28$. The remainder of this sum $\\pmod 8$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "gptanswer": "We can group the terms in pairs: $7438+7446$, $7439+7447$, $7440+7448$, $7441+7449$, $7442+7450$, $7443+7451$, $7444+7452$, and $7445+7453$. Each pair has a sum that is divisible by $8$, so the remainder when the entire expression is divided by $8$ is the same as the remainder when $8\\cdot745$ is divided by $8$. This is $\\boxed{0}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
