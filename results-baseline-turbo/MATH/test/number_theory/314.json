{"problem": "Let $r$ be the remainder when $1342$ is divided by $13$.\n\nDetermine the smallest positive integer that has these two properties:\n\n$\\bullet~$ It is a multiple of $1342$.\n\n$\\bullet~$ Its remainder upon being divided by $13$ is smaller than $r$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Note that \\begin{align*}\n1342 &= 1300+39+3 \\\\\n&= 13(100+3)+3,\n\\end{align*}so $r=3$.\n\nWe are seeking the smallest multiple of $1342$ that is congruent to $0$, $1$, or $2$ modulo $13$.\n\nWe have $1342n \\equiv 3n\\pmod{13}$, so the remainders of the first four multiples of $1342$ are $3,6,9,12$. The next number in this sequence is $15$, but $15$ reduces to $2$ modulo $13$. That is: $$5\\cdot 1342 \\equiv 5\\cdot 3 \\equiv 2\\pmod{13}.$$Therefore, the number we are looking for is $5\\cdot 1342 = \\boxed{6710}$.", "gptanswer": "We first find the remainder when $1342$ is divided by $13$. We can do this by long division or by noticing that $13$ divides $1300$ and $42$ separately, so it must divide their sum, which is $1342$. Therefore, $r=4$.\n\nSince we want a multiple of $1342$ with a remainder smaller than $4$ when divided by $13$, we can simply add $1342$ to a multiple of $13$ until we get a multiple of $1342$ with a remainder smaller than $4$. We can start with $1342$ and add $13$ repeatedly until we get a multiple of $1342$ with a remainder smaller than $4$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1342 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1355 &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1368 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1381 &\\equiv 7 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1394 &\\equiv 8 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1407 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1420 &\\equiv 10 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1433 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1446 &\\equiv 12 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n1459 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{1342}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the conditions is $\\boxed{1459}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
