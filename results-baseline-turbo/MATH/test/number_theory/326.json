{"problem": "The product of three consecutive integers is 720. What is the largest of these integers?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Let the integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.  Their product is $n^3-n$.  Thus $n^3=720+n$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than $720$ is $729=9^3$, and indeed $729=720+9$.  So $n=9$ and the largest of the integers is $n+1=\\boxed{10}$.", "gptanswer": "We can start by expressing the three consecutive integers as $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$. Then, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$(n-1)(n)(n+1) = 720$$\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n$$n^3 - n = 720$$\n\nWe can then rearrange and factor:\n\n$$n^3 - n - 720 = 0$$\n\n$$(n-10)(n^2 + 10n + 72) = 0$$\n\nThe only positive integer solution is $n = \\boxed{10}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
