{"problem": "What is the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits such that the digits add up to 20?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "For the number to be as small as possible, the leftmost digit should be as small as possible. Therefore, the ten thousandth digit should be $1$. The other four digits would have to add up to $20-1=19$. The leftmost digit is now the thousandth digit, which should be the smallest number possible, $1$. We can also put a $1$ in the hundredths place.  The last two digits then have to add up to $20-1-1-1=17$.  The only single-digit numbers that add to $17$ are $8$ and $9$.  Since $8$ is smaller, that goes in the tens place, and the $9$ goes in the ones place.  Therefore, the smallest five-digit number possible is $\\boxed{11189}$.", "gptanswer": "We want the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20. Since the number must be five digits, the first digit cannot be zero. Therefore, the smallest possible first digit is 1. We can then try to maximize the remaining digits while keeping the sum at 20. The largest possible digit is 9, so we can use as many 9's as possible. We can use two 9's, which leaves us with a sum of 2 for the remaining three digits. The smallest possible digit is 1, so we can use three 1's to get a sum of 20. Therefore, the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20 is $\\boxed{11199}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
