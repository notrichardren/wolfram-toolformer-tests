{"problem": "What digit must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer $20\\_7$ a multiple of 11?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work.", "gptanswer": "To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can take the alternating sum of its digits. For example, $9352$ is divisible by 11 because $9-3+5-2=9$. \n\nIn this case, we have $20\\_7$, so the alternating sum of its digits is $2-0+\\_\\,-7= -5+\\_\\.$. To make this a multiple of 11, we need to add 6 to get $-5+6=1$. Therefore, the digit that must be placed in the blank is $\\boxed{1}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
