{"problem": "Find the remainder when $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$ is divided by 4.", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "For any four consecutive integers, their residues modulo 4 are 0, 1, 2, and 3 in some order, so their sum modulo 4 is $0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{4}$.", "gptanswer": "We can find the remainder of each of the four numbers when divided by 4 and then add them up. The remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 0, respectively. Adding them up gives $1+2+3+0=6$. The remainder when 6 is divided by 4 is $\\boxed{2}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
