{"problem": "What is the units digit of $7^7$ when expressed as an integer?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "If we are only interested in the units digit of a product of several numbers, we may drop any digits other than units digits as they will not affect the units digit of the product.  Bringing in each factor one at a time, we find:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{r}\nThe units digit of $\\,7^1\\,$ is 7, \\\\\n$7\\times7\\,$ ends in 9, so the units digit of $\\,7^2\\,$ is 9, \\\\\n$9\\times7\\,$ ends in 3, so the units digit of $\\,7^3\\,$ is 3, \\\\\n$3\\times7\\,$ ends in 1, so the units digit of $\\,7^4\\,$ is 1, \\\\\n$1\\times7\\,$ ends in 7, so the units digit of $\\,7^5\\,$ is 7, \\\\\n$7\\times7\\,$ ends in 9, so the units digit of $\\,7^6\\,$ is 9, \\\\\n$9\\times7\\,$ ends in 3, so the units digit of $\\,7^7\\,$ is $\\,\\boxed{3}$.\n\\end{tabular}", "gptanswer": "We can find the units digit of $7^7$ by looking at the pattern of units digits of powers of 7: $$7^1 \\rightarrow 7$$ $$7^2 \\rightarrow 9$$ $$7^3 \\rightarrow 3$$ $$7^4 \\rightarrow 1$$ $$7^5 \\rightarrow 7$$ $$\\vdots$$ We see that the units digit of $7^1$ is 7, the units digit of $7^2$ is 9, the units digit of $7^3$ is 3, and the units digit of $7^4$ is 1. Since the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we can find the units digit of $7^7$ by finding the remainder when 7 is divided by 4. We have: $$7 \\div 4 = 1 \\text{ remainder } 3$$ Therefore, the units digit of $7^7$ is the same as the units digit of $7^3$, which is $\\boxed{3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
