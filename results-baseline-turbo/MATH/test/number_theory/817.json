{"problem": "What is the only integer value of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is a positive prime number?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is negative if $n$ is less than $-1$ or greater than $13$, so $n$ must be between 0 and $12$ inclusive.  Also, since $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is prime, it must be greater than or equal to 2.  Solving \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{n+1}{13-n} &\\geq 2 \\\\\nn+1 &\\geq 26-2n \\\\\n3n &\\geq 25 \\\\\nn &\\geq 8\\frac{1}{3},\n\\end{align*} we only have to check 9, 10, 11, and 12.  (The multiplication by $13-n$ is justified since we have already know that $n$ is less than 13).  We find that when $n=\\boxed{12},$ the expression equals 13.", "gptanswer": "We have $\\frac{n+1}{13-n}=p$ for some prime $p$. Rearranging gives $n+1=p(13-n)$, or $n=p(12-p)$. Since $p$ is prime, either $p=2$ or $p$ is odd. If $p=2$, then $n=2\\cdot 10=20$. If $p$ is odd, then $p$ and $12-p$ are both even, so $n$ is divisible by $4$. But $n$ is also equal to $p(12-p)$, which is odd since $p$ and $12-p$ are both odd. This is a contradiction, so $p$ cannot be odd. Therefore, the only possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{20}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
