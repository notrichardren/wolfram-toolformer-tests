{"problem": "What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Let $M$ be the least positive multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. First, $M$ is a multiple of 10, so its units digit must be 0. $M$ is also a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, we must take at least  three 2's. Since $M$ is minimal, we take exactly three 2's and do not have any additional 0's: $M=\\boxed{2220}$.", "gptanswer": "We need to find the least multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2. Since 30 is divisible by 2 and 3, any multiple of 30 must also be divisible by 2 and 3. A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even, which means it must end in 0 or 2. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Therefore, any multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2 must have a sum of digits that is divisible by 3.\n\nThe smallest such number is 20, which has a sum of digits of 2. The next smallest is 200, which has a sum of digits of 2 as well. The next smallest is 202, which has a sum of digits of 4. The next smallest is 220, which has a sum of digits of 4 as well. The next smallest is 222, which has a sum of digits of 6. The next smallest is 2000, which has a sum of digits of 2. The next smallest is 2002, which has a sum of digits of 4. The next smallest is 2020, which has a sum of digits of 4 as well. The next smallest is 2022, which has a sum of digits of 6. The next smallest is 2200, which has a sum of digits of 4. The next smallest is 2202, which has a sum of digits of 6. The next smallest is 2220, which has a sum of digits of 6 as well. The next smallest is $\\boxed{2222}$, which has a sum of digits of 8 and is divisible by both 2 and 3, making it the least multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2.", "boxed": "boxed"}
