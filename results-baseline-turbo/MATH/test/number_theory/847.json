{"problem": "Express $555_{10}$ in base $5$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "We write $555$ in powers of $5$. The largest power of $5$ which is smaller than $555$ is $5^3=125$, and the greatest multiple of $125$ which is less than $555$ is $4$. We get that $555- 4 \\cdot 125 = 55$. The largest power of $5$ that is less than $55$ is $5^2=25$, and the greatest multiple of $25$ less than $55$ is $2$. We get $55 - 2 \\cdot 25 = 5$, which is $5^1$. Therefore, we can write $555$ as $4 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^2 + 1 \\cdot 5^1$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{4210_{5}}$.", "gptanswer": "We can use long division to convert $555_{10}$ to base $5$. \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{5} & 2 & 0 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & 3 & 5 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 3 & 1 &  \\\\\n\\cline{3-4}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 2 & 4 &  \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\cline{4-5}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 4 & 4 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, $555_{10} = \\boxed{21010_5}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
