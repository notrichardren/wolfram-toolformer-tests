{"problem": "The two-digit number $``B6,''$ where $B$ is the tens digit, is the square of a positive integer. How many distinct possible values are there for $B$?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Of the two-digit perfect squares, only $4^2=16$ and $6^2=36$ end in $6$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct possible values for $B$.", "gptanswer": "We can write the number as $10B+6$. We want to find all values of $B$ such that $10B+6$ is a perfect square. Let $10B+6=k^2$ for some positive integer $k$. Rearranging, we have $10B=k^2-6$. Since $k^2-6$ is even, $B$ must be odd. Also, $k^2-6\\geq 10$ for $k\\geq 4$, so we only need to check $k=1,2,3$. We find that $k=1$ and $k=3$ do not yield integer solutions for $B$, but $k=2$ gives $B=\\boxed{2}$. Therefore, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ distinct possible value for $B$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
