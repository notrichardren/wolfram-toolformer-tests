{"problem": "Given that $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 12, what is the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by 4 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this problem, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. This limits the possibilities of $d$ to $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since, $5+9+1+3+8=26$, the numbers that satisfy this condition are $1$, $4$, and $7$. The only digit that satisfies both conditions is $d=4$, so the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "gptanswer": "For a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4. We know that $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 4 if and only if the last two digits, $8$ and $d$, form a number that is divisible by 4. Therefore, $d$ must be even. \n\nTo check if $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is $5+9+1+3+d+8=26+d$. For $26+d$ to be divisible by 3, $d$ must be either 1 or 4. \n\nTherefore, the possible digits that could replace $d$ are 0, 2, 6, and 9. The sum of these digits is $\\boxed{17}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
