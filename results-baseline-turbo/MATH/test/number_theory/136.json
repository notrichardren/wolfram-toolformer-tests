{"problem": "When 39,500 is divided by an integer $n$, the quotient is 123 and the remainder is 17. Find $n$.", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "Turning our sentence into math we have \\[39500=123n+17\\]and we want to solve for $n$.  That gives  \\[n=\\frac{39500-17}{123}=\\frac{39483}{123}=\\boxed{321}.\\]", "gptanswer": "We can set up the equation $39,500 = 123n + 17$ to represent the given information. Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\boxed{321}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
