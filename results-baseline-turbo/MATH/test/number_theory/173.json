{"problem": "What is the greatest three-digit integer in which the product of the digits is 6?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "$6=1\\cdot1\\cdot6=1\\cdot2\\cdot3$. To find the greatest three-digit integer the product of whose digits is 6, maximize first the hundreds digit, then the tens digit, and finally the units digit. Of the nine such integers, $\\boxed{611}$ is the greatest.", "gptanswer": "We want to find the greatest three-digit integer whose digits multiply to 6. Since 6 is not a very large number, we can start by trying to find the largest possible hundreds digit. The largest single digit factor of 6 is 3, so the hundreds digit must be 3. We can then try to find the largest possible tens digit. The largest factor of 6 that is less than or equal to 9 (the largest possible digit) is 6 itself, so the tens digit must be 6. Finally, the units digit is just 1, since $3\\cdot6\\cdot1=18$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest three-digit integer whose digits multiply to 6 is $\\boxed{631}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
