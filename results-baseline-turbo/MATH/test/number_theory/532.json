{"problem": "Compute $126_7 - 54_7.$ Express your answer in base $7.$", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "We subtract the rightmost digits as usual. However, for the next digits, we need to borrow as shown: $$ \\begin{array}{cccccc} & & & \\cancelto{0}{1} & \\cancelto{9}{2} & 6_7\\\\ &- & & & 5 & 4_7\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & & & 4 & 2_7\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{42_7}.$", "gptanswer": "We begin by subtracting the units digits, which gives us $6-4=2.$ Since $2$ is less than $5,$ we need to borrow from the $7$'s place. This gives us $2+7-5=4.$ Finally, we subtract the $7$'s digits, which gives us $1-5=-4.$ Since $-4$ is negative, we need to borrow from the $49$'s place. This gives us $1+49-5=45.$ Therefore, $$126_7 - 54_7 = \\boxed{45\\text{ }4\\text{ }2_7}.$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
