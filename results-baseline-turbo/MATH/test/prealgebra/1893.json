{"problem": "When $A$ is doubled, the new value is 10 more than $A$. What is the value of $A$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "We have $2A=A+10\\Rightarrow 2A-A=10\\Rightarrow A=\\boxed{10}$.", "gptanswer": "Let $A$ be the original value. We are given that when $A$ is doubled, the new value is $10$ more than $A$. This can be written as:\n\n$$2A = A + 10$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$A = \\boxed{10}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
