{"problem": "Max must take 10 steps to go the same distance as three of his dad's steps. His dad takes 30 steps to walk down the hall. How many steps must Max take to walk down the same hall?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "Using the given information, we have the ratio $10 \\text{ Max steps} : 3 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Multiplying both sides by $10$, we get the ratio $100 \\text{ Max steps} : 30 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Thus, $30$ of his dad's steps are the same as $\\boxed{100}$ of his steps.", "gptanswer": "Max must take $\\boxed{90}$ steps to walk down the same hall. \n\nWe can set up a proportion to solve for the number of steps Max must take: \n\n$\\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{x}{30}$ \n\nwhere $x$ is the number of steps Max must take. \n\nCross-multiplying gives: \n\n$10 \\cdot 30 = 3x$ \n\nSimplifying: \n\n$300 = 3x$ \n\nDividing both sides by 3: \n\n$x = 100$ \n\nTherefore, Max must take 100 steps to walk down the hall.", "boxed": "boxed"}
