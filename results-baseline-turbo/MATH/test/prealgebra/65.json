{"problem": "Let $N$ be the units digit of the number $21420N$. Which nonzero value of $N$ makes this number divisible by $6$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The number $21420N$ is divisible by $6$ if and only if it is even and the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. So $N$ must be even, and $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$ must be divisible by $3$.  Since $9$ is divisible by $3$, we see that $N$ must also be divisible by $3$. The only digit that works is $N = \\boxed{6}$.", "gptanswer": "For a number to be divisible by $6$, it must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Since $21420N$ is even if and only if $N$ is even, we only need to check divisibility by $3$. The sum of the digits of $21420N$ is $2+1+4+2+0+N=9+N$, so $21420N$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if $9+N$ is divisible by $3$. The only digit that makes $9+N$ a multiple of $3$ is $N=\\boxed{6}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
