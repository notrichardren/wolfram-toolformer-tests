{"problem": "What is the least common multiple of 72 and 96?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "Prime factorize 72 as $2^3\\cdot 3^2$ and 96 as $2^5\\cdot 3$.  The exponent of 2 in any common multiple of 72 and 96 must be at least 5, and the exponent of 3 must be at least 2.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 72 and 96 is $2^5\\cdot 3^2=\\boxed{288}$.", "gptanswer": "We can find the prime factorization of 72 and 96 to determine their least common multiple (LCM). \n\n$72 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$\n\n$96 = 2^5 \\cdot 3^0$\n\nThe LCM will have the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either 72 or 96. Therefore, the LCM is:\n\n$LCM = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 = \\boxed{288}$", "boxed": "boxed"}
