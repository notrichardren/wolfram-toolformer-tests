{"problem": "$97$ is the largest prime less than $100$. What is the largest prime factor of $97!$ (97 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "$\\boxed{97}$ is a prime factor, and everything else that is multiplied together to make $97!$ is less than it.", "gptanswer": "The largest prime factor of $97!$ is $\\boxed{97}$. \n\nThis is because $97$ is the largest prime less than $100$, so it only appears once in the prime factorization of $97!$. All other primes less than $97$ appear multiple times, so they will be factored out before $97$ is.", "boxed": "boxed"}
