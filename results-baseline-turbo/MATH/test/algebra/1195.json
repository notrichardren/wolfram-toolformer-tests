{"problem": "Two consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.  What is the sum of the original  two numbers?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $x + 2$, where $x$ is even. We want to find $x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2$, and we are told that $(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60$. This last equation can be factored as a difference of squares: $(x + 2 + x)(x + 2 - x) = (2x + 2)(2) = 60$. It follows that $2x + 2 = 60/2 = \\boxed{30}$.", "gptanswer": "Let the first even number be $2x$. Then the second even number is $2x+2$. We are given that $(2x+2)^2-(2x)^2=60$. Simplifying, we get $8x+4=60$, so $x=7$. Therefore, the two even numbers are $2\\cdot7=14$ and $2\\cdot7+2=16$. The sum of these two numbers is $\\boxed{30}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
