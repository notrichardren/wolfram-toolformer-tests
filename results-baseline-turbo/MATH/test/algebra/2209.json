{"problem": "For what value of the constant $a$ does the system of equations below have infinitely many solutions?  \\begin{align*} 2x + 5y &= -8,\\\\ 6x &= 16 + a - 15y \\end{align*}", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Putting the $x$ and $y$ terms of the second equation on the left gives $6x+15y = 16+a$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives $6x + 15y = -24$.  So, our system now is \\begin{align*} 6x+15y &= -24,\\\\ 6x + 15y&=16+a. \\end{align*}This system has infinitely many solutions only if the two right sides are the same, which would make the two equations the same.  So, we must have $-24 = 16+a$, so $a= \\boxed{-40}$.", "gptanswer": "We can start by solving the second equation for $y$: \\begin{align*}\n6x &= 16 + a - 15y \\\\\n15y &= a + 16 - 6x \\\\\ny &= \\frac{a+16-6x}{15}.\n\\end{align*} Substituting this expression for $y$ into the first equation, we get \\begin{align*}\n2x + 5\\left(\\frac{a+16-6x}{15}\\right) &= -8 \\\\\n6x + a + 16 - 6x &= -120 \\\\\na + 16 &= -120 \\\\\na &= \\boxed{-136}.\n\\end{align*}", "boxed": "boxed"}
