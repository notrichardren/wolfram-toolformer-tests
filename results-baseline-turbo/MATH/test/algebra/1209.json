{"problem": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days.", "gptanswer": "Let the total amount of supplies purchased be represented by $x$. Then, each person's daily share is $\\frac{x}{12}$, and the total amount of supplies consumed each day by the original twelve people is $12\\cdot\\frac{x}{12} = x$. \n\nWhen the three additional people join, the total number of people becomes 15. However, the daily share for each person remains the same, so the total amount of supplies consumed each day becomes $15\\cdot\\frac{x}{12} = \\frac{5}{4}x$. \n\nTherefore, the supplies will last for $\\boxed{8}$ days, since $\\frac{10x}{x/12} \\div \\frac{5x/4}{x/12} = 8$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
