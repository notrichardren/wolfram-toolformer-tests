{"problem": "The expression $6y^2-y-51$ can be rewritten as $(3Ay+B)(y-C)$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are positive integers. Find $(AC)^2-B$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The expression $6y^2-y-51$ can be rewritten as $(6y+17)(y-3)$. Therefore, $A=2$, $B=17$, and $C=3$. Thus, $(AC)^2-B=(2\\times3)^2-17=\\boxed{19}$.", "gptanswer": "We want to find two numbers $B$ and $C$ such that $6y^2-y-51=(3Ay+B)(y-C)$. Expanding the right side gives $3Ay^2+(B-3AC)y-BC$. We can see that $3A=6$ and $-C=-17$ by comparing coefficients, so $A=2$ and $C=17$. Substituting these values gives $6y^2-y-51=(6y+B)(y-17)$. Expanding the right side gives $6y^2-102y+By-17B$, so we must have $-102+B=0$ and $-17B=-51$, which gives $B=102$ and $B=3$. Since $B$ must be positive, we have $B=102$. Therefore, $(AC)^2-B=(2\\cdot17)^2-102=\\boxed{256}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
