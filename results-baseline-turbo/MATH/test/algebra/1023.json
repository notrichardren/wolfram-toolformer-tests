{"problem": "What is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ in a coordinate system?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\boxed{10}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the origin, the point $(-8, 6)$, and the point $(-8, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse must be $\\boxed{10}$.", "gptanswer": "The distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 8 and 6. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$\\sqrt{8^2+6^2}=\\sqrt{64+36}=\\sqrt{100}=10$\n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ is $\\boxed{10}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
