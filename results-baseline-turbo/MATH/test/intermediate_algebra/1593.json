{"problem": "Find all real numbers $x$ satisfying \\[\\frac{2x-5}{x+3} \\ge 2.\\](Give your answer in interval notation.)", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n \\frac{2x-5}{x+3} - 2 &\\ge 0 \\\\\n \\frac{2x-5 - 2(x+3)}{x+3} &\\geq 0 \\\\\n \\frac{-11}{x+3} &\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we must have $x+3 < 0,$ so $x < -3.$ Therefore, the solution set is $\\boxed{ (-\\infty, -3) }.$", "gptanswer": "We begin by subtracting 2 from both sides of the inequality to get \\[\\frac{2x-5}{x+3} - 2 \\ge 0.\\]Simplifying the left-hand side gives \\[\\frac{2x-5-2x-6}{x+3} = \\frac{-11}{x+3}.\\]Thus we want to solve \\[\\frac{-11}{x+3} \\ge 0.\\]The only way this can be true is if $x+3$ is negative, so we want $x+3<0$, or $x<-3$. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-3)}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
