{"problem": "Let $f$ be a linear function for which $f(6) - f(2) = 12.$ What is $f(12) - f(2)?$", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Since $f(x)$ is linear, $f(x) = mx + b$ for some constants $m$ and $b.$  From the equation $f(6) - f(2) = 12,$\n\\[6m + b - (2m + b) = 12.\\]Then $4m = 12,$ so $m = 3.$  Therefore,\n\\[f(12) - f(2) = 12m + b - (2m + b) = 10m = \\boxed{30}.\\]", "gptanswer": "Since $f$ is a linear function, we know that $f(x) = mx + b$ for some constants $m$ and $b.$ We can use the given information to set up a system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(6) - f(2) &= 12 \\\\\n(m \\cdot 6 + b) - (m \\cdot 2 + b) &= 12 \\\\\n4m &= 12 \\\\\nm &= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo we know that $f(x) = 3x + b$ for some constant $b.$ To find $b,$ we can use the fact that $f(2) = 3 \\cdot 2 + b = 6 + b.$ Since $f(6) - f(2) = 12,$ we have $f(6) = f(2) + 12 = 6 + b + 12 = 18 + b.$ Therefore, $f(6) = 18 + b.$\n\nNow we can find $f(12) - f(2):$\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(12) - f(2) &= (3 \\cdot 12 + b) - (3 \\cdot 2 + b) \\\\\n&= 36 - 6 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{30}\n\\end{align*}", "boxed": "boxed"}
