{"problem": "The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$  Let $h(x) = 2f(x) - 7.$  Find the range of the function $h(x).$", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Let $y = f(x),$ so $y$ can take on any value from $-3$ to 5, inclusive.  Then $2y - 7$ can take on any value from $2(-3) - 7 = -13$ to $2(5) - 7 = 3,$ inclusive.  Therefore, the range of $h(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-13,3]}.$", "gptanswer": "Since $f(x)$ takes on all values in the interval $[-3,5],$ we can write $f(x) = y$ for any $y$ in this interval.  Then $h(x) = 2y - 7,$ so the range of $h(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-13,3]}.$", "boxed": "boxed"}
