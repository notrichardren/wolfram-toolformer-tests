{"problem": "What is the value of the following expression: $100 - 99 +98 - 97 + 96 - 95 + \\cdots + 4 - 3 +2 - 1$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Each pair of consecutive terms makes 1 (for example, $100-99=1$). Since there are $100/2=50$ such pairs, the entire expression is equal to $1\\cdot50=\\boxed{50}$.", "gptanswer": "We can pair up the terms as follows: $(100-99)+(98-97)+(96-95)+\\cdots+(4-3)+(2-1)$. Each pair of terms simplifies to $1$, so the entire expression simplifies to $1+1+1+\\cdots+1$, where there are $50$ terms. Therefore, the value of the expression is $\\boxed{50}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
