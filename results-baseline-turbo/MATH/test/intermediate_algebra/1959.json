{"problem": "The fourth term of a geometric series is $24$ and the eleventh term is $3072$. What is the common ratio?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term and $r$ be the common ratio. Then we have, $ar^3 = 24$ and $ar^{10} = 3072$.  Dividing gives us\n$$r^7 = \\frac{3072}{24} = 128$$which means $r = \\boxed{2}.$", "gptanswer": "Let the first term of the geometric series be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$. Then, we have:\n\nFourth term: $ar^3=24$\nEleventh term: $ar^{10}=3072$\n\nDividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{ar^{10}}{ar^3}=\\frac{3072}{24}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$r^7=2^9=512$$\n\nTaking the seventh root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$r=\\boxed{2}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
