{"problem": "What is the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is the magnitude of their difference. Therefore our distance is $|(5+6i)-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "gptanswer": "We use the distance formula in the complex plane: $|(-2+2i)-(5+6i)|=\\sqrt{(-2-5)^2+(2-6)^2}=\\sqrt{(-7)^2+(-4)^2}=\\sqrt{49+16}=\\sqrt{65}$. Thus, the distance between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
