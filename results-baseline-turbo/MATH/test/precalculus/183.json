{"problem": "Find the mid-point of the line segment with end-points $(7,-3,2)$ and $(4,1,0).$", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Precalculus", "solution": "To find the mid-point, we take the average of the coordinates, which works out to\n\\[\\left( \\frac{7 + 4}{2}, \\frac{-3 + 1}{2}, \\frac{2 + 0}{2} \\right) = \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{11}{2}, -1, 1 \\right)}.\\]", "gptanswer": "The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2},\\frac{z_1+z_2}{2}\\right).$ Applying this formula, we get the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(7,-3,2)$ and $(4,1,0)$ is $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{11}{2},-\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)}.$", "boxed": "boxed"}
