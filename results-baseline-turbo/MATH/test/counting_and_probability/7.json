{"problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only five slices have pepperoni, and exactly eight slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\\boxed{1}$.", "gptanswer": "There are a total of 12 slices, and 5 have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $x$ be the number of slices with both toppings. Then, the number of slices with only pepperoni is $5-x$, the number of slices with only mushrooms is $8-x$, and the number of slices with no toppings is $12-(5+8-x)=x-1$. Since every slice has at least one topping, we know that $x-1\\geq 0$, which implies $x\\geq 1$. \n\nTherefore, the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms is $\\boxed{4}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
