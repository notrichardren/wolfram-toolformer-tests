{"problem": "If the numbers on the third diagonal of Pascal's Triangle are triangular numbers, what is the value of the $50$th triangular number? (The $n$th triangular number is $1+2+3+\\ldots+n$.)", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "If the triangular numbers are found on the third diagonal of Pascal's Triangle, the triangular numbers are  \\[\\binom{2}{0}, \\binom{3}{1}, \\binom{4}{2}, \\cdots,\\]  where the $n$th triangular number is $\\binom{n+1}{n-1}$. We're looking for the $50$th triangular number, which is  $$\\binom{51}{49}=\\frac{51!}{49!2!}\\frac{51 \\cdot 50}{2\\cdot 1}=51\\cdot25=\\boxed{1275}.$$", "gptanswer": "Let the $n$th triangular number be $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We want to find the $50$th triangular number, which is $\\frac{50\\cdot 51}{2} = 1275$. \n\nNow, let's look at the third diagonal of Pascal's Triangle: $1, 4, 10, 20, 35, \\ldots$. We notice that these are the first few triangular numbers! Specifically, the $n$th number on the third diagonal is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1275}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
