{"problem": "Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing two dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$3) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.", "gptanswer": "We can find the expected value by taking the sum of the products of each possible outcome and its probability. The probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of flipping tails is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the expected value is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(\\$3) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
