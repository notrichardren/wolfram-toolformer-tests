{"problem": "How many square units are in the area of the largest square that can be inscribed in a circle with radius 1 unit?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The diagonal of a square inscribed in a circle is a diameter of the circle, so the length of the diagonal of the square is 2 units.  Recall that the area of a square with diagonal $d$ is $d^2/2$.  The area of a square whose diagonal measures 2 units is $2^2/2=\\boxed{2}$ square units.\n\nNote: To derive the area formula $d^2/2$, divide the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.  The side length of the square is $d/\\sqrt{2}$ and its area $(d/\\sqrt{2})^2=d^2/2$.", "gptanswer": "The diameter of the circle is 2 units, so the diagonal of the inscribed square is 2 units. By the Pythagorean theorem, the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{2}$ units. Therefore, the area of the largest square that can be inscribed in the circle is $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\boxed{2}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
