{"problem": "Find the number of square units bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis and the line $x+ y= 6$.", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The region bounded by these lines is a right-isosceles triangle with legs along the $x$ and $y$ axes.  The length of these legs are given by the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line which are both 6.  Thus the area of this region is $\\frac 12 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ square units.", "gptanswer": "The line $x+y=6$ intersects the $x$-axis at $(6,0)$ and the $y$-axis at $(0,6)$. Thus, the triangle formed by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line $x+y=6$ has base and height of length $6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
