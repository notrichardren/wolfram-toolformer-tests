{"problem": "What is the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles of a triangle if two of the interior angles have measures of 63 and 78 degrees?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The exterior angles of a triangle sum to $360^\\circ$, so the average of their measures is $360^\\circ/3 = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.", "gptanswer": "The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, the third interior angle has a measure of 180 - 63 - 78 = 39 degrees. \n\nThe measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two remote interior angles. Therefore, the measures of the three exterior angles are 63 + 39 = 102 degrees, 78 + 39 = 117 degrees, and 180 - (63 + 39) = 78 degrees. \n\nThe mean of the measures of the three exterior angles is (102 + 117 + 78)/3 = 99 degrees. \n\n$$\\boxed{99}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
