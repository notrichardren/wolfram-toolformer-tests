{"problem": "A right square pyramid has a base with edges each measuring 3 cm and a height twice the perimeter of its base. What is the volume of the pyramid?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "The perimeter of the base is $4\\cdot 3 = 12$ cm, so the height of the pyramid is $2\\cdot 12 = 24$ cm.  The base has area $3^2 = 9$ square cm.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $9\\cdot 24/3=\\boxed{72}$ cubic cm.", "gptanswer": "The perimeter of the base is $4\\times 3=12$ cm. Therefore, the height of the pyramid is $2\\times 12=24$ cm. The volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}\\times 3^2\\times 24=\\boxed{72}$ cm$^3$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
