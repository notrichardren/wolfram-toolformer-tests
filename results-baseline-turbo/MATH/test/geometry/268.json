{"problem": "Let $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ be the degree measures of the five angles of a pentagon.  Suppose $v<w<x<y<z$ and $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ form an arithmetic sequence. Find the value of $x$.", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "A pentagon can be partitioned into three triangles, so the sum of the degree measures of the angles of the pentagon is $$\nv+w+x+y+z=540.\n$$The arithmetic sequence can be expressed as $x-2d$, $x-d$, $x$, $x+d$, and $x+2d$, where $d$ is the common difference, so $$\n(x-2d)+(x-d)+x+(x+d)+(x+2d)=5x=540.\n$$Thus, $x=\\boxed{108}$.", "gptanswer": "Let $d$ be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. Then we have $w = v+d$, $x = v+2d$, $y = v+3d$, and $z = v+4d$. Since the sum of the angles in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, we have $$v+w+x+y+z = 5v + 10d = 540.$$Dividing both sides by 5, we get $v+2d = 108$. Since $w = v+d < v+2d$, we have $w < 108$. Since $z = v+4d > v+3d$, we have $z > 3(108) - 2v$. Since $v<w<x<y<z$, we have $v < z-4d$. Combining these inequalities, we get $$v < z-4d < 3(108) - 2v < 108.$$Solving this system of inequalities gives $v < 72$, $z > 288$, and $v < 54$. Since $v$ is an integer, we have $v \\leq 53$. Since $v+2d = 108$, we have $d = (108-v)/2$. Since $x = v+2d$, we have $x = v+(108-v)/2 = (v+108)/2$. Since $v \\leq 53$, we have $$x = \\frac{v+108}{2} \\leq \\frac{53+108}{2} = \\boxed{80.5}.$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
