{"problem": "Let $N$ be the units digit of the number $21420N$. Which nonzero value of $N$ makes this number divisible by $6$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The number $21420N$ is divisible by $6$ if and only if it is even and the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. So $N$ must be even, and $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$ must be divisible by $3$.  Since $9$ is divisible by $3$, we see that $N$ must also be divisible by $3$. The only digit that works is $N = \\boxed{6}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: remainder(21420n,6)=0, n!=0", "wolframoutput": "{hit/((21420 n) mod 6) = 0, n!=0}", "gptanswer": "The number $21420N$ is divisible by $6$ if and only if it is divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Since the number ends in $N$, it is clearly even, so it is divisible by $2$ regardless of the value of $N$. To be divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$. The sum of the digits of $21420N$ is $2+1+4+2+0+N=9+N$. Therefore, $21420N$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if $9+N$ is divisible by $3$. The only nonzero digit that satisfies this condition is $N=\\boxed{3}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
