{"problem": "Amy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy have $36$ apples that they plan to split among themselves in a ratio of $2:3:3:4$, respectively. How many apples will Betty and Cathy have together?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "The four girls are dividing the $36$ apples into $2+3+3+4 = 12$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{36}{12} = 3$ apples per part. Together, Betty and Cathy have $3+3 = 6$ parts, so they will have $3 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ apples.", "wolframquery": "Query: (3/8)*36+(3/8)*36", "wolframoutput": "hit:27", "gptanswer": "The total ratio is $2+3+3+4=12$. So each \"part\" of the ratio is $\\frac{36}{12}=3$. Betty and Cathy together have a ratio of $3+3=6$ out of the total ratio of $12$, so they will have $\\frac{6}{12}\\cdot 36=18$ apples together. \n\nTherefore, the boxed answer is $\\boxed{18}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
