Substituting the given values, we can see that $16\\cdot 21=336=C$.  Using this $C$ value, we can solve for $j$ when $k=14$: \\begin{align*}\nj\\cdot 14&=336\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad j&=\\frac{336}{14}=\\boxed{24}\n\\end{align*}", "wolframquery": "Query: j=16,k=21,j*k=16*21,k=14,j=?", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "Since $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional, we know that $j \\cdot k = \\text{constant}$.
