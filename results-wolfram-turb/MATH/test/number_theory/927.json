{"problem": "Given that $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 12, what is the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by 4 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this problem, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. This limits the possibilities of $d$ to $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since, $5+9+1+3+8=26$, the numbers that satisfy this condition are $1$, $4$, and $7$. The only digit that satisfies both conditions is $d=4$, so the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: sum of digits of (59138x mod 12) from x=0 to x=9", "wolframoutput": "hit:42 digit", "gptanswer": "Since $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4. To be divisible by 4, the last two digits must be divisible by 4, so $d$ must be even. To be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. We have $$5+9+1+3+d+8=26+d.$$ Since $26$ is not divisible by 3, $d$ must be such that $26+d$ is divisible by 3. The possible values of $d$ are 0, 3, 6, and 9. \n\nTo find the sum of all possible values of $d$, we can use the Wolfram Query response. We compute $59138x \\bmod 12$ for $x=0,1,2,\\ldots,9$ and sum the digits of each result. We get $$\\begin{aligned} 591380 &\\equiv 8 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 8 \\\\ 591381 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 9 \\\\ 591382 &\\equiv 10 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 1+0=1 \\\\ 591383 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 1+1=2 \\\\ 591384 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 0 \\\\ 591385 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 1 \\\\ 591386 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 2 \\\\ 591387 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 3 \\\\ 591388 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 4 \\\\ 591389 &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12} &\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad& 5 \\end{aligned} $$ The sum of all these digits is $8+9+1+2+0+1+2+3+4+5=\\boxed{35}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
