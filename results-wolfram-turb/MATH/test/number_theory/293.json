{"problem": "What digit must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer $20\\_7$ a multiple of 11?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work.", "wolframquery": "Query: (20x+7) mod 11 = 0, solve for x.", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "To determine if $20\\_7$ is a multiple of 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that the alternating sum of the digits must be a multiple of 11. In other words, $20\\_7$ is a multiple of 11 if and only if $2-0+\\_\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. \n\nTo make this true, we need to find a digit to replace the blank such that $2-0+$digit $\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Since $2-0=2$, we need to find a digit that is congruent to $9$ modulo $11$ (since $2+9=11$). The only digit that satisfies this is $\\boxed{9}$. Therefore, the four-digit integer $2097$ is a multiple of 11.", "boxed": "boxed"}
