{"problem": "Find the remainder when $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$ is divided by 4.", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "For any four consecutive integers, their residues modulo 4 are 0, 1, 2, and 3 in some order, so their sum modulo 4 is $0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{4}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: remainder when 91145+91146+91147+91148 is divided by 4", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The remainder when a number is divided by 4 is the same as the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 4. Therefore, we can find the remainder of each of the four numbers when divided by 4 and add them up to find the remainder of the entire sum.\n\n$91145 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n\n$91146 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$\n\n$91147 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n\n$91148 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n\nAdding these remainders, we get $1+2+3+0=6$. Therefore, the remainder when $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$ is divided by 4 is $\\boxed{2}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
