The next number in this sequence is $15$, but $15$ reduces to $2$ modulo $13$. That is: $$5\\cdot 1342 \\equiv 5\\cdot 3 \\equiv 2\\pmod{13}.$$Therefore, the number we are looking for is $5\\cdot 1342 = \\boxed{6710}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: smallest positive integer multiple of 1342 with remainder mod 13 less than remainder of 1342 mod 13", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "We begin by finding the remainder when $1342$ is divided by $13$. We can do this by long division or by noticing that $13$ divides $1300$ and $42$ separately, so it must divide their sum, which is $1342$. Therefore, $1342 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$.\n\nNext, we want to find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of $1342$ and has a remainder upon division by $13$ that is smaller than $4$. Since $1342$ is a multiple of itself, we can simply add $1342$ repeatedly until we get a multiple of $1342$ with a remainder smaller than $4$. We have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1342 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n2 \\cdot 1342 &= 2684 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n3 \\cdot 1342 &= 4026 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n4 \\cdot 1342 &= 5368 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n5 \\cdot 1342 &= 6710 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n6 \\cdot 1342 &= 8052 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n7 \\cdot 1342 &= 9394 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n8 \\cdot 1342 &= 10736 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is $\\boxed{10736}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
