{"problem": "How many of the first one hundred positive integers are divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5?$", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Number Theory", "solution": "We could do this by the divisibility rules, but that would be quite tedious. It's easier to note that a number divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$. This is because a number which is divisible by several integers must be divisible by their least common multiple -- however, since $3, 4,$ and $5$ are relatively prime, the least common multiple is just the product of all three. Clearly, there is only one number between $1$ and $100$ divisible by $60;$ that is, $60$ itself. Thus there is only $\\boxed{1}$ such number.", "wolframquery": "Query: how many integers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 3, 4, and 5?", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "To find the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5, we need to find the number of integers that are divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5, which is 60. \n\nTo find the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 60, we can divide 100 by 60 and round down to the nearest integer: \n\n$\\lfloor \\frac{100}{60} \\rfloor = 1$\n\nSo there is only one multiple of 60 between 1 and 100. \n\nTherefore, the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5 is the same as the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 60, which is $\\boxed{1}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
