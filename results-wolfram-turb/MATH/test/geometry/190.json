{"problem": "A right circular cylinder with radius 2 inches and height 1 inch has the same volume as a second right circular cylinder. The radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch. How many inches are in the height of the second cylinder?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Geometry", "solution": "Let the second cylinder have height $h$ inches.  Setting the two volumes equal we have $\\pi(2^2)(1)=\\pi(1^2)(h) \\Rightarrow h = \\boxed{4}$ inches.", "wolframquery": "Query: volume of right circular cylinder with radius 2 inches and height 1 inch equals volume of right circular cylinder with radius 1 inch, solve for height of second cylinder", "wolframoutput": "Wolfram Alpha could not find an answer and encountered an error.", "gptanswer": "The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.\n\nLet $h_2$ be the height of the second cylinder. We know that the volumes of the two cylinders are equal, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$$\\pi (2^2)(1) = \\pi (1^2)(h_2)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$4\\pi = \\pi h_2$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get:\n\n$$h_2 = \\boxed{4}$$", "boxed": "boxed"}
