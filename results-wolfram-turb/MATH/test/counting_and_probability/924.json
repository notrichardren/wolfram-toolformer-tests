{"problem": "A nursery employee wishes to plant 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "We have 7 places to plant trees in our row.  We can choose two of these to be Golden Delicious in $\\binom{7}{2}= \\boxed{21}$ ways.  For each of these choices, we plant the Bartlett pears in the remaining 5 places.", "wolframquery": "Query: 2!*5!", "wolframoutput": "hit:240", "gptanswer": "The total number of distinct arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the apple trees and the number of ways to arrange the pear trees. Since the two apple trees are identical and the five pear trees are identical, we can use the formula for permutations with repetition:\n\nNumber of ways to arrange 2 identical objects in a row = 2!\n\nNumber of ways to arrange 5 identical objects in a row = 5!\n\nTotal number of distinct arrangements = 2! * 5! = $\\boxed{240}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
