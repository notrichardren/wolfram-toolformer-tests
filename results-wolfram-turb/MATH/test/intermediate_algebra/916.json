{"problem": "What is the value of the following expression: $100 - 99 +98 - 97 + 96 - 95 + \\cdots + 4 - 3 +2 - 1$?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Intermediate Algebra", "solution": "Each pair of consecutive terms makes 1 (for example, $100-99=1$). Since there are $100/2=50$ such pairs, the entire expression is equal to $1\\cdot50=\\boxed{50}$.", "wolframquery": "Query: 100-99+98-97+96-95+...+4-3+2-1", "wolframoutput": "hit:50", "gptanswer": "We can group the terms as follows: $(100-99)+(98-97)+(96-95)+\\cdots+(4-3)+(2-1)$. Each group of two terms simplifies to $1$, so we are left with $50\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{50}$.", "boxed": "boxed"}
